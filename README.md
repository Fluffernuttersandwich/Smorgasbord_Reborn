## MO2 Customization

**Do NOT change load order unless you know what you’re doing.**

- Choose **ONE UI Suite**
- Choose **ONE Perk Suite**
- Enable optional mods as desired

---

## Random World Generation

- Recommended size: **6–10k**
- RWG may take **5–60 minutes**
- Descent adds large underground systems (keep maps 6-10k)
- CompoPack adds a ton of POIs.
- The unique RWG mods make the process take longer.

---

## Dedicated Servers

- Multiplayer supported
- Dedicated servers supported
- Server and clients must match mods
- EAC must be disabled

---

## Updates

- Track the Smorgasbord Mod Page on NexusMods
- Update via Wabbajack
- Overwrite existing installation
- New versions may require a new save


Just like you downloaded everything the first time.
The difference is, it will only download new/updated mods.

**Standard warning:** There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.

If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!

There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough.

Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!
