2.5.1.1 23:30 EST 26DEC2025

Exclusively for 7DtD game version 2.5

Comments:

1. We're back!  I took a much needed break and have decided to ressurrect the Mod List.  
I missed playing, modding, and interacting with the community.  
I apologize for leaving the list in a bad state when I left, I accidentally formated my old PC to pass it on to my son.

2. Going forward, I will maintain Smorgasbord, but to protect my own sanity I will be keeping user needs at arms distance.  
What this means to you:
A. Fewer and slower updates. I'll shoot for monthly.  
B. Less one on one troubleshooting help from FNS. I am working on other projects and am still 66% RTO.  
C. Everyone is going to have to ask on another in this community to help shoulder the burden of providing user assistance with the list. 

3. Current Plans:
Add more of the old mods we're missing for 2.5 as they get updated and/or I have time to test them.  
We are missing vehicles, Avatars (VRoid waifus), the CompoPack, and some other heavy hitters.

Gratitude:
StallionsDen for managing my mods during my absence.  I owe him big time!  

For new folks, welcome, for old faces, welcome back!
