Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Updated:

"Endless Harvest"
"Natural Selection"
"Singularity"

Mods Added:

"Stop Bikes From Falling Over" Standard, enabled.
This is one of those "should be vanilla" mods.

"Witos's FAV" Vehicle, enabled.
Adds a vehicle.

"Bell Go Bong" Audio, enabled.
I chose the variant that just makes a sound when you strike the bell block.
There's an alternate version that summons zombies, but I decided not to do that one.

"Dismember Randomizer" Zombies, disabled.
Zombies can randomly spawn in with missing limbs.

"POI Scourge" QoL, enabled.
A checkmark is placed on the map of each Cleared POI. 
This happens either when you successfully vanquish all zombies on a Clear Quest, or when you kill all of the entities in a POI Boundary outside of a quest.

"Server Enforced Brightness" Graphics, enabled.
Requires Singularity! Disallows other players from changing Brightness on a server.

"TraderSync" Experimental, disabled.
TraderSync let's players use the same NPC trader at the same time and keeps the trader’s item list synced for everyone.
I haven't had the oppurtunity to test this yet. Please let me know if it works in multiplayer without issues.
