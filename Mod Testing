2.5.1.6 14:10 EST 29DEC2025

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. A community member named donelofficial put in a request on the GitHub Issues tracker for me to add new mods (and missing old ones) to the list.
Most of the additions were by his request.

2. Added the Perks Separator.  I think most of the Perk mods might need some updating. 
I only did initial testing to confirm no immediate errors at launch into game world.  
I think these are OP in general

3. Added Experimental Separator. Test and or use these mods at your own risk.
Example: Kajdaniec asked for "Extended World Settings".  
It's "safe" so long as you don't go to extremes in either direction for the settings.  
I don't have the time to test it all. Use good judgement or keep this mod disabled.

Mods Removed: 
1. Wild West NPC Cow Hands and add-on patch mods. 
I don't have time to figure out the error it's throwing.

Mods Fixed:
1. Charred Meat Replacer
If you see other warnings or benign errors that might be easy fixes, please let me know.

Benign Warnings: 
1. The Descent
2. WalkerSim
3. Closer Weapon's Pack
4. There's likely more I'm missing

Benign Errors:
1. OCB Maurice's Parachute mod. It will open the console with an Error, but it still works.  
The mod is disabled by default until he updates it. 
This happens every time TFP updates the game, but OCB usually only recompiles his mods when something is actually broken.

2. When you combine FNS Bait Bags + The Descent, it will throw a silent (console does not open) benign error. 
It's overwriting the same file, but it's fine.

Mods Updated:
1. Danzo Screamers. Fixes.
2. Danzo Hide version number. More options for use.
3. Custom Avatars (VRoid).  Camera, hands, and vehicle issues fixed.
4. Clement Weather (is now working as intended)

Mods Added:

1. “More Skill Points Per Level” OP, disabled.
I did not add every variant, just the one for 3 points a level. 

2. “Autominers” OP, disabled.
