Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.

There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

2. For DLSS fans, Nvidia has opened access to the new DLSS 4.5 in beta. You have to opt into it yourself within the Nvidia Geforce app > Settings > About > Early access to beta.
