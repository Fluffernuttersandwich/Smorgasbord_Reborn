2.5.1.8 16:15 EST 31DEC2025

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. Added a new Separator for the CompoPack (CP).  
All of the mods within it are disabled by default.
Warning: CP POIs are more challenging than vanilla. 
Also, you get a mixed bag of serious and silly POIs.  
If that is not your jam, just keep these disabled.
A. The Modded-CP contains vanilla POIs built with the Custom Blcoks Pack.
B. The Custom Unity Block Pack (CUBP) contains fancier Unity assets in these POIs.
C. There are also NPC-specific POIs, but you must toggle the NPC-Core mod to use these or you will have errors. 

2. I got a message today someone asking for a separate light-weight Mod List. 
They didn't want as many decor, vehicle, and silly mods.
I get this sort of message fairly regularly.
Here's my general response when I get this request: No.
It's a lot of work maintaining one Wabbajack Mod List already.
I don't want to duplicate my efforts. If I include everything, you can just toggle your preferences.   
I am not interested in Power Fantasy Gaming, but I include Overpowered mods for those people.
I don't play with NPCs, but again, some people love them. 
I don't play with Decor mods, but again, for some people, that's their main thing.  
It would be easier for me if I only included the mods I use in my own game, but this list was made to be modular.
It was also made as a showcase for all of the best (compatible) mods in the community.
I don't tell people how to play, I just provide them options.
The whole point of Smorgasbord being on MO2 is that it allows users to choose what they want like a buffet table.

Standing Community Requests:

1. Development of a MO2 Profile around converting Smorgasbord to work with IZPrebuilt's LBDR Mod (plus patches).
I made a very bare bones Profile, it probably works, but is very meager compared to the full list. 

2. If any of you have suggestions for improving the GitHub look, functionality, or have ideas for new pages then please let me know.
