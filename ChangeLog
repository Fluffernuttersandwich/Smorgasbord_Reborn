Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. A community member named donelofficial put in a request on the GitHub Issues tracker for me to add new mods (and missing old ones) to the list.
Most of the additions were by his request.

2. Added the Perks Separator.  I think most of the Perk mods might need some updating.
They should work without errors, but temper your expectations accordingly.
I only did initial testing to confirm no immediate errors at launch into game world.  
I think most of these are OP in general.

3. Added Experimental Separator. 
Test and or use these mods at your own risk.

4. Renamed the EFTX Separator to Weapons and moved some mods around.

5. Massive Overhaul of the GitHub ReadMe! 
A. I added new usable links for the Table of Contents, and embedded within.
B. Added new pages to segment: Troubleshooting, Dedicated Server, Adding Your Own Mods, etc.

Community Requests:

1. If someone out there wants to develop a MO2 Profile around converting Smorgasbord to work with IZPrebuilt's LBDR Mod (plus patches).
2. If any of you have suggestions for improving the GitHub look, feel, or new pages, please let me know.

Mods Removed: 
1. Wild West NPC Cow Hands and add-on patch mod. 
I don't have time to figure out the error it's throwing.

Mods Fixed:
1. Charred Meat Replacer
If you see other warnings or benign errors that might be easy fixes, please let me know.
I sent the fix to the author.

Mods Updated:
1. Danzo Screamers. Fixes.
2. Danzo Hide version number. More options for use.
3. Custom Avatars (VRoid).  Camera, hands, and vehicle issues fixed.
4. Clement Weather is now working as intended

Mods Added:

1. “More Skill Points Per Level” Perks, disabled.
aka 3 Skill Points Per Level

2. “Autominers” OP, disabled. 
Adds new workstations to automine resources.

3. “Efficient Base Repair” Optional, enabled. 
Adds an Efficient Base Repair block.  
Put base repairing resource inside of it and it will repair your base automagically.
You can also toggle it to be able to upgrade your base as well. 
It will do this randomly, so if resources are limited, I recommend you manually upgrade your key blocks.

4. “Hydroponic Farming” Standard, enabled.
Plant indoors in hydroponic tray workstaions. This is not an intuitive system. 
You might need to read up on the NexusMods page to figure out how it works.
One is for seed crafting, the other is for actually growing plants.

5. Perks, disabled.
“Natural Progression” 
“Perk Mastery” (must use CATUI or SteelUI once it's updated for 2.5)
"Legend Perks" (must use CATUI or SteelUI once it's updated for 2.5)
"Legend Perks add-on nerf"

6. “Endless Harvest” OP, disabled.
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/7554
Harvested plants convert back to sapling plants.

7. "Extended World Settings" Experimental, disabled.
It's "safe" so long as you don't go to extremes in either direction for the settings.  
I don't have the time to test it all. Use good judgement or keep this mod disabled.

8."No Blurry Textures" Experimental, disabled.
This mod is very hardware dependant. 
I don't need it for myself, but some users might benfit by this to prevent blurry texture load-in issues. 
Sometimes this mod might add an occasional random freeze-frame stutter to the game for a second. 
This mod might be better for low end gaming hardware.

2.5.1.5 16:00 EST 28DEC2025

Added more than 30+ mods we used to have in the older version of Smorgasbord.  
I was able to continue playing in the same 2.5 world I started in an earlier revision, but...

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!

2.5.1.3 14:10 EST 27DEC2025

Exclusively for 7DtD game version 2.5!

Comments:

1. Smorgasbord is back!  I took a much needed break and have decided to ressurrect the Mod List.  
I missed playing, modding, and interacting with the community. Plus my kids kept bugging me about it.  
I apologize for leaving the list in a bad state when I left, I accidentally formated my old PC to pass it on to my son...
It took a bit of time to fix, and restore the list from the ground up.
It's not 100% yet, but we'll get there.


2. Going forward I will maintain Smorgasbord, but to protect my own sanity I will be keeping user needs at arms distance.
This is to prevent burnout on my end.
What this means to you:
A. Fewer and slower updates. I'll shoot for monthly.  
B. Less one on one troubleshooting help from FNS. I am working on other projects and am still 66% RTO.  
C. Users are going to have to wait for assistance, use the log bot at Guppy's, rely on help from other community members, figure it out themselves, or suffer.

3. Current Plans:
Add more of the old mods we're missing for 2.5 as they get updated and/or I have time to test them.  
We are missing lots of vehicles, Vehicle Madness, Avatars (VRoid waifus), the CompoPack, and some other heavy hitters.

Gratitude:
StallionsDen for managing my mods during my absence.  I owe him big time!  

For new folks, welcome, for old folks, welcome back!

2.3.2.1 23:30 EST 21SEP2025

For Game version 2.3

Comments:

1. You probably need to start a new save... this is not because that many mods updated, but because I have been disabling several mods.
There are so many changes, it could mess up your existing save.  
Like always, if you are happy with your current playthrough: WAIT, TO, UPDATE!

2. I found myself getting into a rut playing the same way over and over. 
My recent playthroughs were getting too easy.
So, I am making the default list more challenging.  By default, it will force the player to work harder for everything.  
I didn't add any grind, just disabled (but left in place) some mods that were too OP.
I find it that when I am constantly desperate and barely surviving, I have a better time with 7DtD. 
If you don't legitmately fear death, you play sloppy, and you have less fun.

3. Caution: I edited WalkerSim settings. 200 Zombie population, and EnhancedSoundAwareness (sonic hearing) set to true. 
It appears the author Zeh_Matt has improved it, so it's not as overwhelming as it was.  However, stealth matters!
I want to try a playthrough with it set like this for a greater emphasis on stealth as a challenge. 
Recently I started watching TWD for the first time, and really liked the importance of stealth and speed.  
You are of course free to edit it to however you like.

4. Renamed the EFTX Separator to Weapons.  
It's EFTX, Izy AIO, add-ons to both, and other more popular weapon mods.  

5. One of our Community Members Rwdillin75 has been experimenting with IZPrebuit's Learn By Doing Returns mod. 
CAUTION! I added this mod to the list, but it is VERY EXPERIMENTAL! 
You need to be a bit of an advanced mod user to attempt this with Smorgasbord.  
You have to disable a few dozen mods for this to work.
Basically, if a mod effects progression, perks, or crafting recipes tied to progression, it needs to be disabled!
I will be posting a follow-up guide in the GutHub ReadMe once I test it out some more.  

Gratitude:
ALo, Feras, and the rest of the guys discussing the Headshot Only conversation in our Discord channel at Guppy's. 
I love productive brainstorming conversations that lead to cool mods and better ways to play.  

Mods Removed: 

"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable" It's superfluous with "Quest Revamp".

Mods Added:

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack07 The Walking Dead" Armor, enabled.
Adds armor and cosmetic options from TWD.

"Guppycur's Fire AddOn to Score" QoL, enabled.
Back by popular request: Guppy's Fire adds Fire Extinghuishers, the ability to summon a biplane to drop water on an area, and other fire related goodies.
Previously, this mod was having errors in 2.0, but either something in a Score update, or the settings I selected for FireManagement fixed the errors we had. 
Caution, not tested on a Dedicated Server. If someone with a Dedi can test the Extinguisher on a fire, and check logs, that would be great.  
User sentiment: "Hey Fin, wouldn't it be nice to be able to you know, actually put out the fires, just sayin'."

"FNS No Crispies with Guppy's Fire Mod v2" QoL, enabled.
If you disable Guppycur's Fire, also disable this mod! 
Prevents Guppycur's Fire Mod from converting zombies set on fire to Burnt Zombies... I like molotovs to actually kill zombies, not just convert them to crispies!

"Remote Explosive Charges - with optional Safe Cracker add-on" QoL, enabled.
Portable explosives with remote detonation. 
One for breaking blocks, one for damaging zombies, one for safe-cracking. 
Don't like your undead neighbors car? Blow it up from your toilet! 
Want to expand your base but that pesky wall is in the way? 
Blow it up from a safe distance! Wanna just cause mayhem? It can probably do that too.

"Headshots Preferred by FNS" Survivalist, enabled.
Headshots do 33% more damage, body shots do 33% less damage.  
Mod Author ALo gave us this modlet, so please thank him if you appreciate it.
Recommendation from Fin: From a recent playtest, I think it might be best for most players to disable the Armored Zombies mod from EFTX if using this mod.  
Unless you really like an insane challenge. 
My reasoning is this: Feral zombies with helmets, especially Wights are brutal in the early-to-mid game when you don't have AP rounds.
They have high hit points, they get on top of you in the blink of an eye, and you already do low damage to their lower body.  
This could be fun for a minority of players, but this would be unpleasant to most.  
Armored Zs is now disabled by default with a note explaining this. 

"Brain Dead Zed" Zombies, disabled.
From the Author: The zombies will, mostly, no longer act like structural engineers, bee-lining for the weakest part of your base from the far side. 
They will now, more so, approach and attack from the direction they saw you from. 
This acts a bit more like the old AI, or the AI from alpha 16, but without the issues from the time.
Most zombies are now 'stupid' zombies. 
Utility worker (construction) zombies retain the current 'smart' AI, and the Demolition zombie was given the 'smart' AI, making them far more dangerous.
Zombie Dogs and Dire Wolves were left untouched.
Be warned, your standard stilt cheese base will not work! 
Only a fraction of the zombies will use your stairs, unless you get very lucky and the horde just approaches from that direction.
From Fin: I disabled this by default because taking away a zombie's ability to climb stairs easily makes some POIs a worse experience. 
It's there if you want it. 

"No More Drill Claws" Zombies, enabled.
In vanilla 7 Days to Die, when a zombie has several 'allies' close by, they get a 20% block damage boost per 'ally.' 
So, when a horde is attacking a wall, they can easily tear through even the hardest blocks. 
For many people, this seriously breaks immersion, as a small group of rotting corpses will tear through a cubic meter of concrete in about the same time you can dig through it with an auger.
This mod addresses that problem by completely removing the feature. Zombies will no longer get any block damage boost when in groups. As a result, concrete walls actually act like concrete.

"GirlsFrontline Jiangyu RaindropCleavingBlades" Custom Avatars (VRoid).
Just another waifu.

"(V2) Classic Crack-a-Book HQ" POI, enabled.
Adds an updated version of the old tier 5 Crack-a-Book HQ.
TFP created the original POI, but arramus updated it for v2.
Many people preffered the older version compared to the new one.
"(V2) Atomic Burger" POI, enabled.
Adds in a reconstructed version of the base game's Wasteland rubble version which has been partially destroyed.
It is a T2 POI hooked up for fetch, clear, restore power, and Infested. It can appear in the commercial, downtown, and country residential locations.
Note: I have not updated the Smorgasbord Maps yet, so if you want to see these new POIs, run a new Advanced RWG.  

"Recipes for Resin by FNS" Standard, enabled.
This is a small Add-On modlet for the Archery Expansion mod. 
My mod adds additional recipes to allow for different uses of the Resin resource added to the game by the Archery Expansion mod. 
It provides new alternative recipes for: Torches, Glue, Aloe Cream, and Goldenrod Tea.

"Shrader's NPCs All-in-One" NPCs, disabled.
Adds a ton of new NPCs to the game. 
I only briefly playtested this mod, no errors, the NPCs spawned in game and functioned as expected. 

Mods Updated:

"LittleRedSonja's CAS"
"Witos Camera"
"DanzoLootBagAndAnimalIncreaseTimer"
"Clopex Estate"
"Gella Park"
"Serenity - Cave Prefabs"
"7 Days of Insomnia"
"MXMRMXs poi pack"
"(V2) Summon Animals (NPC Mod Add On Pack)"
"Enhanced LCB" Fixed, Standard, re-enabled. 
"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time"
"(V2) Oakraven Fish Farm"
"Medical conditions(alternative rest buff source)"
"Random Zombie Speed" This didn't update, but I dialed down the max speed from 3 to 2.5, since they were a little too fast. 

All of WookieNookie (WMM) mods have been updated.

"Custom Avatars" This was previously called VRoid. 
If you have a problem with aiming, Aim Down Scope (ADS), go into this mod's menu golden hexagon in the character tab and uncheck "Aim Correction".
Alter created a workaround to remove the "third hand" when combining this mod with IZY AIO... however, it's not perfect.
Using Izy + Custom Avatar (VRoid) will still do a funny thing with the hands changing from 3rd person view to FPV when you ADS.
Your Custom Avatar hands will be temporarily be replaced with the Izy hands when you ADS when using Custom Avatar (VRoid).
This is because Izy does his hands differently than vanilla or EFT-O/X.
Izy currently does not have plans to update his hands.
If you play as a male character in the base game of 7DtD, but use a female Avatar, with Izy guns, you will switch to man-hands in ADS/1st Person View. :P

"Rainstorm" 
Laydor added different levels of Fog: You can change this setting in the Gears Mods menu. 
He has Normal vanilla game fog, Rainstorm mode improved fog, and a Silent Hill level of oppressive constant fog.

Comments:

1. Hot fix, small update on a few mods.

2. POI Errors loading into a newly generated world: Most likely a "Descent" issue

In previous versions, most of the time, Descent could generate a map larger than 10k.
However, now in 2.3, it fails more often than not.  
It has intermittent issues!
Sometimes it will Error and hang, and you need to exit the game.
Sometimes it can "stealth fail" where the map generates, doesn't pop-open the Console showing that The Descent failed to run, 
but still spit you out a map that when you go to launch your game, it's riddled with POI errors.
For now, if using The Descent to perform Advanced RWG, stick to maps lower than 10k.
If you want to try for larger maps, run RWG with the Console open, and be prepared for it to take multiple attempts.  
Or, just use my default maps, they all have Descent, even the 12k and 13k

2.3.1.1 21:15 EST 12SEP2025

ALERT! The Smorgasbord ModList has moved to STABLE game version 2.3!

Major Update: This will 100% require a new save!

Comments:

1. It wasn't as bad as going from 1.4 to 2.0, but still a lot of restarting and testing. 
I did swap, disable, edit, and move a few mods around on the list.  
I keep striving for balance in the default selection of enabled mods.

2. I am starting to test adding pregenerated maps for Smorgasbord, you'll see them under the RWG Separator.
These were made using Advanced RWG with mods, not handmade manual map tools, I don't have the time for that.  
If you choose to deselect The Descent mod, these maps should still work.
I'm doing this to save players some time, and help people with weaker hardware.

A. "9k_Popular_v231"
You must enable MPLogue and Zeebark's POI packs to use this map! 
This map has the following POI Packs disabled: DwarvenCitadel, CompoPack, and WildPigCastle.
If you add/enable any additional POIs, they will not show up on this map, because it was pregenerated without those POIs!

B. "10k_Default_v231"
This map has the following POI Packs disabled: DwarvenCitadel, CompoPack, WildPigCastle, MPLogue, and Zeebark.
This map uses the default enabled POIs I already preselected.  So long as you leave the POI Separator mods alone, this map works. 
If you enable those additional POIs, they will not show up on this map, because it was pregenerated without those POIs!

C. "12k_All_v231"
To use this map, you must enable EVERY mod under the POI Separator, including the CompoPack.

D. "13k_All_plus_NPC_v231"
To use this map, you must enable EVERY mod under the POI Separator, including the CompoPack.
You must also enable at least the first three mods under the NPC Separator in MO2.

Mods Removed: 

"Jareth Vehicle Turn Table" Errors.  We still have "VehicleSpinner V1" at home.  
"Dot Crosshair" Replaced by TMO's.  
"Fasterer Lockpicking" Replaced by Tam's.

Mods Added:

"Witos Hovercraft" Vehicles, disabled.
Adds Hovercraft.

"Player Movement Patch" QoL, enabled
Patches the game to fix issues with player movement. 
In particular, some issues related to sprinting occur when the sprint lock option is disabled. 
Therefore, if the sprint lock option is enabled, this mod will have no effect on sprint behavior.
Fixed an issue where tapping a key briefly would cause the player to continue sprinting even after the key was released. 
This behavior is commonly referred to as Toggle Sprint, and this Mod also disables Toggle Sprint if the Sprint Lock option is disabled.
Fixed an issue where releasing the sprint button after opening a container or inventory with the sprint button held down would cause the container or inventory to remain in sprint state even after closing it.
Fixed an issue where holding down the jump key would cause the player to jump again immediately after landing.

"Hunlight's 7DtD Rebalance" Survivalist, enabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
Introduces a comprehensive progression system with delayed iron, steel, and mechanical advancement alongside stricter trader tier requirements. 
This standalone mod features balanced zombie XP, economy adjustments, and improved containers while remaining fully compatible with most other mods.
I haven't seen any errors, but other mods you have enabled for increased loot will nullify the purpose of this mod.

"TMO Crosshair Plus" UI Suite, enabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. Customizable Crosshair. 
Change shape, size, and color in the Console. 
For crosshair Console commands, see NexusMods documentation or video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST1SJtBBM9Y
I like that this mod works well in 3rd person for modded guns like Izy Shotguns and Rifles.  

"Animal Babies" Zombies, disabled.
Adds baby animals.  It's disabled because they're too small for my personal taste.  

"Archery Expansion" Standard, enabled.
Adds three new arrow and bolt types: Scrap, Iron Hunter, Steel Hunter.  
Scrap arrows/bolts are just a variant cheap arrow/bolt, better than stone, but not as good as Iron.  
"Hunter" arrows cause bleeds.  Steel being superior Iron.
Adds some new bow/crossbow weapon mods.  
Your boy Fin made this mod compatible with "Transmute Arrows to Bolts"
Note! Some of the recipes require tree seeds to boil down to resin to create carbon fiber so keep "FNS Self-Planting Trees" disabled if you want to use this mod.  

"Tam's Improved Lockpicking" OP, enabled.
75% faster lockpicking, 75% more durable lockpicks, spending more perks points in the skill.

"Pick Locked Doors" OP, disabled.
This mod destroys the intended path of a POI experience, but I do beleive in personal choice.
On one hand I like the realism and freedom of being able to unlock doors and go your own way.
On the other, it allows cheeseballs to go straight through steel doors for end loot.   

"Serenity Cave Prefabs by Svarii" POI, enabled.
This pack for The Descent, adds some new cave entrances and underground filler prefabs.

"Klukai SpeedStar" VRoid, Avatar, already manually added.
Another waifu.

Mods Updated:

"EFT Recoil Patch"
"FPV Legs"
"TechFreq's Extra Briefcase" This is now a catchall mod to replace the multiple previous mods that added up to this. 
"(V2) 1-SCore Remote Crafting and Auto-Sort Drop Box"

"CATUI"
"IZ Prebuilt Imersive Survival Water"
"Better Pipe Guns"
"Score"
"Gears"
"Quest Area Timer (test!)"
"Quartz"
"7DaysSuperResolution"
"Bobcat"
"Insomnia" Big thanks to ByteBlazar for extending it to work with Blood Moon Chaos.

Comments:

1. I tested SMX UI Suite. It sort of works for Smorgasbord, but I am deciding against inclduing it for now because it's a bit too buggy.
You can add it to your own game.
If someone here wanted to make a patch for it, I would include it, but not as it stands now. 
I actually prefer CATUI and SteelUI. And those rarely have issues with other mods. 

2. We are still on 2.2, and I expect when 2.3 goes Stable, it will break a lot of mods.  
So, when this happens, it might take me some time to update Smorgasbord. 
I will work on it as time permits, but remember, I can't move forward without the dependancy mods that support us.
I know things like Quartz, Gears, Score, and a bunch of mods that touch UI screens will need to be updated. 
I have at least a dozen more I know that will need to be updated so far.  

3. Added a separator for "Advanced Random World Generation"
A. I moved my RWG mixer there.
B. PGz is for casual users who just want to generate a world and jump right in.
C. World Gen Tweaker + Randomized Traders is for more advanced users.
For users who won't mind possibly generating multiple worlds to get something special they really want.
Disable this whole section if using CompoPack.


Mods Removed: 

"GNS Slashing Axes"
"Tool Time"
Both were replaced by "IZPrebuilt's Tools are Weapons".

"Galaxy Far Far Away"
"(TMO) Interchangeable Skies x Custom Skybox Support"
Both were replaced by Laydor's "Rainstorm".

Mods Added:

"2.0 Danzo Hide Version" QoL, enabled.
Hides the game version normally displayed on the top right of the screen. 'Makes for nicer screenshots and videos. 

"IZPrebuilt's Tools are Weapons" Standard, enabled. 
Makes tools more viable weapons without being OP or requiring books. Other adjacent book series Perks work for them.  

"GirlsFrontline Cheeta"
"MillenniumTourELF stranger cosmos (rabbit)" VRoid, Avatar, already manually added.
More waifus.

"Razz's Unarmed Combat Flow" OP, enabled.
Makes using fists a more viable combat option for folks who like to engage in some fisticuffs.

"Customizable Difficulty" Zombies, enabled.
This mod is set to default game difficulty until you manually change it in GEARS. 
Uses GEARS to allow you to edit player and zombie damage and health. 
Allows you to customize player and zombie stats. 
This way it also allows you to go beyond Insane difficulty!
Changing player and zombie modifiers is done from the New/Continue screen before loading into your game. 
Currently limited to Damage and Max Health. 
Ranges between -75% and +200% for Health, -75% and +500% Damage for zombies, capped to +200% for the player.

"Rainstorm" Environmental, enabled.
Laydor's Rainstorm mod overhauls the vanilla clouds, skybox, and visual weather effects systems. 
It adds new volumetric clouds and volumetric fog and a physically based skybox, with more to come.

Comments:

Over the last several months I have been trying to improve the "default" mods enabled in Smorgasbord to make it a more balanced experience. 
With this latest update, I am trying to steer the "default" experience to be more intricate and challenging. 
When I say intricate, I don't mean unnecessarily confusing, I'd hate that. I'm aiming for pleasantly complex, while remaining intuitive.  
I want the player to have to manage more for a grittier game experience where decisions matter.
And I also love the random interruptions from mods like: Blood Moon Chaos, Better Storms, WalkerSim, and Random Zombie Movement.

I have changed the name of the catch-all separator to "Survivalist".
I also used a uniform phrase you can filter by in MO2 "Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)!"
A CBM is anything that adds a layer of complexity, challenge, or thoughtful change to provide a more stimulating experience over vanilla.  
For a long time people have viewed Smorgasbord as just "whatever you want it to be" which it still can be depending on how you personalize your experience.
But, for a default experience, I really want to deliver something with character.
People hate bland play-it-safe games, they want a memorable experience.  

As you all have seen, A16 is all the rage right now. 
If I was to try and condense the main attractions of A16, I'd say this: Sophisticated players want a more engaging game.
2.0 vanilla is too dumbed down.  So how can Smorgasbord's default-as-delivered Mod List offer players what they really want?

1. Non-linear experience: People hate being railroaded to the same path every game.
With the mods I selected and modified, I have tried to offer the freedom players want without removing or completely overhauling existing systems. 

2. Intricacy: They want complexity without convolution. 
Survival games should not resolve all survival issues too early into a playthrough.
I really think the mods I've recently added and tweaked will scratch that itch.
Better Storms, Immersive Survival, Medical Conditions, Insomnia. 

I understand not everyone is going to like Medical Conditions or Insomnia, but again, they can just disable them.
However, I think people should try them to see how it makes for a grittier game where your choices and skill matter.

Getting injured in the early game has serious consequences with the Medical Conditions mod.

The 7 Days of Insomnia mod forces you to manage sleep and the safety of your sleeping area. 
You have to more carefully plan your forays into the world.
Even though I have personally moved away from classic horde base construction in recent playthroughs, 
I do like feeling the pressure of securing a place to sleep out of the elements.

Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Added:

"Darks Soldierz" NPC, disabled.
Adds neutral/ally Soldiers.

"Darks Cleanerz" NPC, disabled.
Adds hostile Soldiers.

"Arrows And Bolts Cause Bleed" OP, enabled.
Vanilla Arrows and Bolts cause bleeds, if you take points in the Deep Cuts Perk.
I don't think it's too OP, I think it just helps keep archery relevant in the middle-to-late game.

"ProjectileBleedMod" OP, disabled.
Vanilla guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
"IZY_Bleed_Patch" OP, disabled.
Vanilla and Izy guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
Both of these were disabled by default because in my opinion, guns don't need a buff in Smorgasbord.

"IZPrebuilt's Improved Loot Experience" OP, enabled.
This mod aims to add more immersion, choice and risk vs reward to 7 days to die 2.0
by adding a bunch of low level T1 and T2 items back to the logical loot table like what was already in the game a few alphas ago. 
It adds tools to tool containers and guns and weapons to gun containers. Recommend new playthrough, with hard zombies to compensate.

"Rope and Realism" Survivalist, enabled.
Makes rope a required resource to craft as an ingredient in some recipes to increase immersion and complexity.

"Nails and crafting adjustments" Survivalist, enabled.
Adds nails as a requirement ingredient to crafting recipes that would logically require them.
Adds nails as resource items received when salvaging several blocks. Adds nails to stone tools crafting, generally to replace duct tape.
The point of this mod is to make nails more important since they are only needed for the Workbench and then you never use them again in the vanilla game.  

"Immersive Calendar" UI, disabled. 
Does not work with CAT and Steel UI, only when using the vanilla HUD. 
A small modlet that changes the date display below the compass.

"Medical Conditions" Survivalist, enabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
Adds complexity to medical conditions for a more challenging game. 
Adds around 50 negative medical conditions to enhance survival experience. 
Identical symptoms from different conditions dont stack(With few rare exceptions).
Vanilla food and medications gain new meaning as a treatment to those conditions.
Added vitamins system to back up hypovitaminosis.
Variety of biome-specific conditions and ways to surpass them.
Some vanilla perks ineract with medical conditions in an intuitive and predictable way.
Medical conditions are hidden by default. 
To reveal them, players must diagnose them by either: having the corresponding Physician perk level (1–3), or reading enough Medical Journals (25, 50, or 75). 
Higher Perception reduces the required number of Medical Journals. Players can check allies by standing next to them.

"ByteBlazar's Screamers" Zombies, enabled.
Makes Screamers silent until they shout their Alarm. 
Also replaces vanilla screamers with Feral and Radiated versions. 
So if you are mining away, or hanging out in your base, 
you will not be able to distinguish normal zombies thrashing around outside your base with a Screamer until she shouts the alarm.
Their movement is also uniquely creepy.  

"New Spawn Start Zone" Survivalist, disabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
This mod requires you to manually edit the xml to allow you to pick a different starting Biome.
For you hardcore nutters, you can now spawn into a different biome and be forced to survive its hardships immediately. 

"CrouchStaminaRegeneration" OP, disabled.
Crouching makes your stamnia regenrate much faster. Too OP!

"Faster Paintbrush and Infinite Paint" Standard, enabled. 
Self-explanatory.

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack06 Resident Evil" Armor & Decor, enabled.
New RE inspired Armors!

Mods Removed: 

"Little Buddy" The Mod Author pulled it. 

Mods Added:

"Random Zombie Speed" Zombie, enabled.
Zombies have a random speed rating regardless of your game speed setting. 
I did reduce the top speed, because the author set it past Nightmare+ speed.
It was too janky and unpleasant. 
After reducing their top speed, it's much nicer!  

"Oak's Bandit Head Hunters" NPC, disabled.
Adds new Bandit Head Hunters.
Unlike the Zombie Head Hunters, these are balanced as is.

"MXMRMXS POI Pack" POI, enabled.
Some of the POIs are not as balanced as you might hope for, but not bad, he just might be new, idk.
What I like is that he's innovating, and trying some new ideas.  We need more of that daring in POI design.
His "Runaway" POI is pretty fun.

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on the STABLE game version 2.2!

Fin is 95% sure you will need to start a new game with this update!

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.

Comments:

1. "0-SCore" Fire Spreads is now the default for Smorgasbord. 
I like Fire Spreads. I think it should be vanilla. 
If you don't like Fire Spreads, or are worried about performance on a server, you can manually disable it.
To Disable Fire Spreads, go into 0-Score's blocks.xml file. 
(use Notepad++, you can download it for free!)
Search (Ctrl+f) the blocks.xml file for "FireManagement" , and set these values to false.
                <property name="Logging" value="false"/>
                <property name="FireEnable" value="false"/>              
                <property name="FirePersists" value="false"/> 
Additionally, Sphereii, the author of Score, has gone to great lengths to improve Fire's impact on performance.
It's much better than it used to be. Most systems should be able to handle it.

2. "Apocalyptic Quests" 
Disabled for now. 
You can play with it (I am), but I labeled it Experimental for now.
It needs an update!
Some of the Quest Markers for Infested/Special quests cannot be found/interacted with at POIs.

3. "Izy AIO" Major Update!
See that page for details.

Mods Removed: 

"Guppycur's Fire" I enabled Fire Spreads in Score.
"...No Crispies" it was an add-on to Guppy's Fire.

Mods Added:

"Singularity" QoL, enabled.
"XFX"

"Better Biomes harvest perk patch" Graphics, disabled.
Add-on to BB. Fixes tags for trees in the Better Biomes mod to be affected by perks that increase yield (i.e. Motherlode).

"Dismantle Items to Schematics" Standard, enabled. 
Allows you to disassemble an item like a quad-pocket-mod for some (not all) of the resources.
You must do this at the workbench!
It grants you the schematic to reproduce more of that item. 
Like a reverse-engineering toolkit mod.  
Currently it's only limited to a few recipes.  
More will be added in time!

"LittleRedSonja Punisher NPC" NPC, disabled.
Adds neutral/ally hireable Frank Castle (The Punisher). 
The only way to stop the bad guys is to hire a worse one, And Frank is ready to help you kick some zombie ass.

"GirlsFrontline ClukaySummer" VRoid, Avatar, already included when you enable the main VRoid mod.
Just another scantilly clad waifu.

"Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods" OP, disabled.
1. Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods lets you buy all vanilla vehicle parts and vehicle mods starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse. 
2. All traders carry bicycle and minibike parts.
3. Trader Bob has also all the parts for the Motorcycle, the 4x4 Truck, and the Gyrocopter and all the vehicle mods. 
4. Traders will NOT carry complete vehicles (to be confirmed).

"Undo Block Placement" Standard, enabled.
Usage: Press Control+Z to try and undo your placement
Settings
You can undo 10 placements within 60 seconds of placing a block by default. You can customise this behaviour in the ModSettings.json file that gets created after the first time the mod loads.
MaxUndoSeconds = how many seconds since the block placement can it be undone (default 60. Zero means no time limit)
MaxUndoHistory = how many blocks to keep track of (default 10)
Close and re-open the game if you want to apply changes to your settings.
Rules when undoing:
1) The block must be the same type that you placed
2) The block can NOT be damaged. Once repaired it can be undone.
3) The chunk must be active (i.e. you have to be in the area)
4) You have to have space to receive the block into your inventory

Mods Updated:

"Zombie Fall Damage"
"Runtime OCD" now enabled. ByteBlazar improved performance, no longer set to 'very verbose'.

Comments:

1. "Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable" is now set to disabled. 
Normally this mod allows you to take more than one quest at a time.
Currently this mod can be intermittently buggy. The bug intensifies if playing with Apocalyptic Quests. 
If you go to a quest marker, and it's missing (or you can't interact with it), you need to complete and return other quest(s) prior to initiating this one.
You might also need to exit/reenter the game.
When JNS updates his "MoreQuests" for 2.x, I will try his again... it's currently hidden, pending his update.
I know WookieNookie (WMM) was also working on something similar, but I don't think he's made it public yet.

Added/re-added two separators:

Perk Suite

Apocalyptic Quests

Renamed the "Biome Progression" Separator to "Survival, Weather, Biome Progression Options" to allow more things into it.
I moved a bunch of other mods into this section.
I am trying to appeal to users who want to make the survival aspects of the game more challenging. 

Mods Removed: 

"POI Renamer" 
Was causing too many glitchy UI problems.

"Babel Inc POI" 
Too much of a performance sink... 
overlapping lights, too many zombies spawning all at once, building is too large, too many reflective surfaces.
You (might) get away with one of those problems, but not all at once, it kills your FPS.
It dropped my FPS from 80 to 20, and I'm not even playing with Better Biomes, NPCs, or Triple Infested POIs. 

"Remove Intro to Buried Supplies Quest"
"Danutas Reasonable Quest Time Limits"
"Reset Trader's Quests"
All three of these mod features were incoporated into "Quest Revamp-Gears Edition" as options.

Mods Added:

"Sort Trader's Quests by Distance" Quest, enabled.
Lists quests at the trader selection screen by those closest to you first.
I think this mod just fell off the list when I wasn't looking.
Or maybe it was part of a different mod that I removed.  
Either way, the feature is back.

"Quest Revamp-Gears Edition" Quest, enabled.
Adds a Gears UI screen to toggle Quest mod options. Also adds some other Quest UI functionality for compatibility with other Quest mods.
This is very customizable, and I encourage you to tailor it to your playstyle. 
One major change I made by executive decision. You can now Move up Quest tier after 1 job instead of 10. 
That just alarmed some of you, and you're out there shouting: "Why?!"
Fin's the master chef cooking you up somehting nice, so hear me out on describing this dish:
Because it rewards players who have the balls to want to tackle harder POIs earlier. 
It also keeps you from having to do the same old tier 1-3 POIs you always do. 
If you can handle higher tier POIs, why not?
No one is forcing you to do higher tier POIs. 
Yes, this can throw off balance a bit, but it encourages players to make a risk vs reward decision.
I personally find being stuck doing tier 1-3 POIs in order to stifle my play style. 
I want to have the freedom to challenge myself, but I also want to be properly compensated!
This setting is *Chef's Kiss.  
And, most importantly: If you don't like the change, you can either disable the mod, or change it back to 10 in the Gears Mods menu UI.
Caution: If you did a quest for Rekt that opens up the next quest tier level with Rekt, please remember to reset quests!
This is important if you bounce between traders before reseting jobs!
Example of what not to do: Finish one job with Rekt, immediately go see Jen, take a tier 2 quest from Jen, cannot find/interact with that Quest Marker.
If you complete a job, you can reset the trader jobs to open up the next tier level!  This should resolve any missing Quest Markers.

"IzPrebuilt's Immersive Survival" Survival, enabled.
Water mod.
This mod aims to increase immersion, freedom and challenge to return 7 Days To Die to a more sandbox survival experience. 
Currently this only tackles hydration. 
Disinfect your water in a variety of ways and then filter it. 
You can also work towards late-game water objectives.

"Damage Numbers" UI, enabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. When you shoot zombies, it displays damage numbers over their heads similar to Borderlands.
This is configurable in-game, in Mods settings.

"UI Sound Mod" Sound, disabled.
From the Mod Author: Simple mod that replaces some (57) of the more repetitious, arguably annoying sounds (hovering, clicks, opening the backpack etc). 
Customizable in xml.
From Fin: The vanilla sound effects don't bother me personally, and the new ones are too mild for my taste.

"Immersive Camera" QoL, disabled.
From the Mod Author: Adds leaning, swaying, breathing, and head-bob to the first person camera. Also allows altering the player height. 
All settings can be configured via CameraEffectsConfig.txt.
From Fin: Do not use this mod if you are prone to video motion sickness. 
Adds "realistic" head-wobble when the character is moving. 
Effects aiming and 3rd person! 
A community memeber asked me to include this mod, so I did, but I think most people will disable this mod after trying it for about 30 seconds. 

"Tip of the Spear by FNS" Standard, enabled.
Just a small boost to the Spear Hunter book series to keep the spear more relevant into late game... 
I promise this is not OP, it's a very mild boost.
I felt the spear was left behind by the sledgehammer, stun baton, etc. 
Spear is one of the greatest melee weapons ever made and games rarely do it justice. 

"Perk Mastery" Perks, enabled.
You must use either SteelUI or CATUI for this mod to function! 
This is because the vanilla UI might not display the extra column for the new Perk System.
Do not mix with most other modded Perk suites (like "Legend Perks or "Flogi's..."). Pick one main Perk Suite only!
This mod offers a wide variety of Perk Masteries that you can unlock after allocating the default ones.
For example, after taking a point in Archery, the Bowman mastery unlocks!
Adds new perk trees for every weapon in the game!
Start a new game!
If your previous game had Legend Perks, do not use this mod simultaneously! 
If you ignore my advice, and try to play with two Perk Suites at the same time, only one will be selectable in the Skills screen!
Or you could get game breaking errors... have fun with that.
Example: if you try to play with both Legend Perks and Perk Mastery, only Perk Mastery will be selectable. 
I disabled Legend Perks just to play with Perk Mastery for a while to see which I prefer. I like them both.

"VRoid - Avatar - Master Chief from Halo 3"
Queue up that Gregorian chant intro boys, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 has got another mission against The Flood.

"Apocalyptic Jobs" 
Click the link to NexusMods (from MO2) to read more! 
Adds a whole bunch of new quest types, boss encounters, perks, magazines, and expansions. 
The subsequent AddOn mods help you configure Apocalyptic Quests by disabling features from it you'd rather play without.
It will largely take over the Quest menu. 

One of the Add-On patches to "Apocalyptic Jobs" is causing an error: "(ADDON) More Vanilla Quest Chance"
Here Fin is asking for any and all community assistance to troubleshoot. 
Currently this patch is causing an error where you can't choose quests at the trader, it's probably a Mod Conflict. 

Mods Updated:

"Drone Weapons"
"Blood Moon Chaos" Fixed the Quest Progression bug.
"Hunlight's Rebalnce of Guppy's Zombies"
"FNS Super Rad BMX"
"Halicopter"
"CATUI"

I moved a few mods out of Experimental, as I was able to test them more extenisvely.

2.2.1.1 22:10 EST 08AUG2025

Major Update: Smorgasbord has been updated to stable game version 2.2!

Standard warning: There's no gurantee you can play in an old save. You can try to make a back up and test it, but chances are it won't work.
If you are happy with your game on 2.1, wait to update both the game and list until you are ready to move to a new game. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. SteelUI was not updated for 2.2, but I made some easy fixes myself for 2.2 for the list.  
It's not perfect, you will see containers with more slots than should be available.
The SteelUI suite was moved to a new separator called: Pending Update to 2.2

2. There is a new Experimental separator at the bottom of the list. 
The mods here are new(ish) and I have not had extensive amounts of time to play with them. 
I am asking anyone who's willing to risk losing a playthrough to extensively help me test them and report back.
If you don't want to take that chance, leave them disabled.  
I only tested that they didn't cause initial errors or introduce obvious problems into the early game. 
I am fairly confident OCB's mods will be problem free.
Blood Moon Chaos and Halicopter could potentially cause issues...

3. We just hit over 500 modlets on the list.  Wow! This list started with 60 mods about 18 months ago!  

Mods Removed: 

"Backup Mod" Kajdaniec reported it was broken. It was glitchy when I last tested it, so pulling until it receives an update and can be reassessed. 

"GW71_NoMagazineXP" replaced with my own improved version.

Mods Added:

"TechFreq's Pouch Add-Ons to OCB's Pouch system." OP, mostly disabled.
I enabled the one for the wallet, because I like being able to store all Dukes in one slot like every other video game ever. 
The others are disabled for: Medical, Ammo, snacks, and Minerals. Too OP for me. 

"Enhanced LCB or Enhanced Land Claim Block (V2.1)" OP, enabled.
Primarily for unlocking doors/garage-doors for POIs you take over as a base. It has other uses. 
Please don't use the Enhanced LCB to cheese loot locked behind doors, that's not what this meant for! 
It was meant to be a convenient QoL item to unlock existing doors in a POI you want to make your home base.

"No Exp from Reading" QoL, disable.
You do not receive experience points for reading any book, magazines, or schematics. 
This includes modded versions so long as they used normal item name nomenclature. 
This mod was made for people who prefer slower progression to keep the game going longer.
This is a niche mod, but it's how I like to play. 
There's nothing wrong with double looting a Crack-a-Book POI, I don't mind the LBR system, but the double-dip makes leveling with reading too good.  

"The Walking Dead Avatar Pack UPDATED 2.1" VRoid, disabled, but already added to the Avatar folder.
New TWD Avatars added to VRoid.

"Babel_Inc" POI, enabled. 
I haven't found/run it yet. It was a request.
I do try to listen to you guys most of the time...

"POI Renamer" Standard, enabled.
Mount this block inside the boundary of a POI, and you can rename it to whatever you like.


"OCB Pretty Grass (V2.X)" Standard, enabled.
Superior Grass shader.  Not glow in the dark grass liek vanilla.

New(ish) Experiemntal mods, disabled. 
"OCB Electricity Wind Power (V2.X)"
"OCB Electricity Overhaul (V2.X)"
"OCB Electricity Multiway Switches (V2.X)"
"Blood Moon Chaos" 
Random Blood Moons! It's customizable in the xml. In-Game Blood Moon GUI Settings don't matter. 

Mods Updated:

"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" 
StallionsDen provided me with some new Military Assets for the Disposable Heroes POI.  
Sincerely appreciated mate!

"Steel UI Suite" added some additional backpack options. 

"EFTX" 

"TechFreq's Spikes and Mines"

"Better Storms..."

"All of Hunlights mods" name changes mostly.  

__________________________________________________________


2.1.5.4 16:00 EST 06AUG2025

Minor Revision: 
Standard warning applies! There's no gurantees an update won't break an existing save. 
It's always best practice to wait until you want to start a new game before updating.

Comment:
Adjusted "Better Storms Biome Progression and More" disabled Horns open Doors feature, because I re-added the mod that does that back in.  
I like the mod version better for increased functionality.  Leave that setting disabled!

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"QuickStack" Standard, enabled. 
My fault, I was using an old version.

All of the Funukemaguro's Icon replacer mods. QoL, enabled.

2.1.5.2 20:50 EST 05AUG2025

Hotfix: updated Additional Research after finding capitalization issue in a case sensitive xml file for Additional Research.

Note: I removed the Perks Separator, it's just under OP now.  

Mods Removed: 

1. "OCB Map Waypoints (V2.0)" Removed because a new Mod Conflict with other new mods... most likely the next mod: "Better Storms Biome Progression and More"

2. All of the mods under the Biome Progression Separator. Someone out there is gaspging; "Nani?!"
They were all replaced by Jawoodle & FuriousRamsay's "Better Storms Biome Progression and More"
Other modlets removed because they are now part of "Better Storms Biome Progression and More"
"Horn Opens Doors"
"TheMeanOnes Return of Empty Glass Jar"
"Reduce Insect Swarm Debuff"

3. "TiaoZaoMinimap" Quest Reward screen bug with "WMMTraderQuestMap" and "FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again"

A lightweight patch that corrects the spawn progression of the Guppy Zombies mods, preventing powerful zombies from appearing in the early game for a more balanced experience.

"Izy's Pistols in Toilets, Cars, and Purses" OP, enabled.
Optional add-on for Izy so you have a very low chance of finding Izy pistols in those places after certain gamestages.

Adds a handful of Bandit POIs filled with hostile NPCs. 
You must RWG a new world with Score + NPCCore and this mod enabled. 

"CollectedItemListFix" QoL, enabled.
You know how when you collect too many items/resources, it can often jumble the display showing an overlapping mess of items piled on top of one another? 
This mod fixes that issue.

Enable this along with either of the two Better Lighting mod versions. Drop your in-game Brightness setting to 0%, and this mod will help improve NVG display.

Starter Kit, start with box of Tier 1 items.  
I prefer Hunlight's for balance, where you start with a box of Tier 0 items.

Allows you to make what are normally xml edits in 0-Score, within the GEARS GUI menu.

Really nice QoL ultra-lightweight modlet removes the Duke’s note from your starting inventory.

FNS Gratitude Shout Outs:

leopardtheboss: For offering his "Zombies eat gore" framework as opensource from his Descent mod.  I used it in my Bait Bag mod. 

Guppycur: For hosting the Discord server, and his kind words.  He's kept it going for a long time, and kept the community in a healthy state.

TFP: For addressing the community concerns to perform the needed course correction on Biome Progression. 
Not an easy decision I'm sure, but it was the right move.  

To the folks who hang out in my FNS channel at Guppy's... we get up to some fun banter and productive mod discussions.

This mod makes Bdubs Vehicles spawn as repairable vehicles if using Vehicle Madness.
Ivern the Cruel did a great job with this one. Well done buddy.  

"OCB No Sudden Exit" Standard, enabled.
Adds a delay when exiting an aircraft to buy you enough time to hit the Esc key to cancel.

"OCB Remote Turret Control CCTV (V2.0)" Standard, enabled.
Remote control station for using the sentry guns.

"NPCX Spider Colony" NPC Suite, disabled.
This mod has been nerfed since the previous edition which is a good thing.
The Queen Spiders are still not to be triffled with!
If you think the spiders are too strong, let me know...

"Fari's Lightsabers" OP, disabled.
Too OP, but fun.

"WalkerSim" 
Now the zombies have much better hearing! Stealth will be a priority, especially in the early game.
Zombie Population Density has been set to 180 in the WalkerSim.xml file. Adjust it to your own liking.  
WalkerSim and NPCCore are now more compatible with eachother. 
If playing with NPCCore, you should see fewer NPCs since WalkerSim will not be spawning them.
Makes for a less frantic experience. 
If the Walker's hearing is too much for you, you can disable it in the xml: <EnhancedSoundAwareness>false</EnhancedSoundAwareness>

Return of the NPCs 
For real this time!

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Big thanks to Xyth, the creator of the NPCCore mods. 
I asked, and Xyth was kind enough to host NPCCore from NexusMods. 
This fixed the NPCCore download issue we were having.
Please endorse his mods and say thanks to him for making them available to us.
When a mod author lends support to help Smorgasbord, please let them know you appreciate it.

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough. 

Mods Removed: 
AGF HUD is no longer compatible with Smorgasbord. 
Sorry, I know some people love that UI Suite, but the latest upgrade messes up the perks menu.

Mods Added:

"Wasteland Cuisine" QoL Optional, enabled.
Adds new food and beverage recipes using vanilla ingredients. No loot bloat.

"NPCCore Suite" NPC, disabled.
Re-added after working with Xyth to distribute the mods from NexusMods.  

"Skyrim Style Lockpicking Minigame" QoL Optional, disabled.
Standalone mod.
Do not use a gamepad on locks! Requires 0-Score (already enabled as a Framework mod).

2.1.2.4: HOTFIX 16:40 20JUL2025

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.

Removed NPCCore for now.  There is an issue with the NPCCore Git links. I will try to re-add them in later.

"OCDRuntime"

Mod Status change:


2.1.2.3 Minor Revision 15:30 EST 20JUL2025

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough. 

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:
"Wasteland Cuisine" adds new recipes using existing ingredients, so no loot bloat.

Mods Updated: 

"GNS Beautiful Bases"
"Alternative Biome Progression"
"Tool Time" 
"Witos Camera"
"NPCCore Suite"
"VRoid" Added new Avatars.

Mod Status change:

I Broke "NPCCore" into sub-component mods. So, if you want to play with normal NPCs, but not robots, you can disable robots individually.

"Descent" I did just figure something out.  I was getting some lighting flickering at night outside.  
It was Descen't cave-lights folder.  The author told me I could safely remove it.  I am removing it going forward.

2.1.2.2: HOTFIX 15:35 19JUL2025

Fixed NPC Mod downloading error.  It was my mistake. Files need to end in .zip, not .git, silly Fin being silly. 

Re-Added old / Updated the WookieNookie WMM mods on the list.

The NPC Suite is a bit different.  
Lockipicking game, Mechs, and birds are part of the main mod... you can remove what you don't want locally.
I'll try to make this more modular in the future, but I was pressed for time today.

YOU MUST START A NEW GAME WITH THIS UPDATE!


2.1.2: 12:10 EST 19JUL2025

Major Revision Warning:
I'm 99% sure this update will destroy an existing save. EFTX update, Weather Returns update, removed MoreShots... 
Either continue to play your current game as is, or update when you are ready to start a new save.

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  
There was a bit of confusion on my part... did TFP sneak a mini revision into 2.1 Stable from b7 to b9? idk 

This is the NPCs return to 2.0 update.

Reminder: Adding your own mods to this ModList voids the warranty on getting assitance from FNS.  
I will work to reduce/eliminate issues in the list I provide you, but I cannot help you when you make your own additions.
It's not that I don't want to help you, it's just my time is limited.  When you add stuff, you are on your own!

Mods Removed: 
"PGz Massive Cities" swapped for "World Gen Tweaker".
"More Shots" messes with Izy AIO crafting unlock progression.

Mods Added:

"LittleRedSonja Barbie Davidson Vehicle" Vehicle, enabled.  
Adds a Pink Barbie-themed Harley-Davidson to the game

"Vayben's Deployable Mineshaft" OP, enabled.
Portable Mineshaft spawner block. 
Create a mineshaft spawner block, deploy the block, activate the block, watch the magic as it hollows out a mineshaft. 
Mineshaft comes with a door, walls, hatch, and ladder down. Best placed on an ore vein. It hollows out dirt and stone, leaving the ore for you to mine at your leisure.  

"POIs Always Infested x3" Quest mod section, disabled by default.
Do not combine with "Harder Infestations". 
This might effect your FPS on higher tier POIs. 
This mod triples the amount of zombies spawning in all POI quests. 
Not just Infested missions, but all POIs will have triple the amount of zombies.  

"Collectible Toys" Decor, disabled.
Adds a set of collectible toys and a wooden shelf you can build to display them. 
"Nikke Standees - Collectible Toys Addon"
Must have "Collectible Toys" enabled! Adds 478 acrylic standees with art from Nikke. 
These are scantily clad anime waifu.

"NPCCore Suite" New Separator, all disabled by default.
NPCs are still a bit experimental and janky. 
NPCs will drastically change the game. Maybe play a test game for an hour or two before deciding you want to settle in to a long play with them.
By default NPCs are common. They will also spawn in with/without WalkerSim.  
Some users complain NPCs are loud, annoying, and disrupt the more chill vibes of the vanilla apocalypse feel of the game. 
I added them to the list because some player like the dynamic variety they add.
Some of the add-ons bring in unkillable neutral/ally NPCs. Read the notes carefully.
Some of the add-ons are silly. Weird animals, friendly zombies with guns, robots, etc.  
I will continue to include more add-on NPC packs as they come online for 2.0.  I only included updated/functioning mods.

"Doros VRoid Avatar" VRoid, and I already added her to the VRoid mod folder.
Another anime waifu.

"No More Storm Warnings" Biome, enabled.
Turns off the on-screen-display notification that a storm is incoming.
It makes for a more fun experience not knowing.

"World Gen Tweaker" POI, enabled.
"Randomized Traders (v2.1)" POI, enabled.
These mods allow for smaller and maps 2k-16k, cities in the forest biome, more cities, larger cities, and unlocks traders from specific biomes... Not just Rekt in forest.
I would reccomend 6k-12k maps in general. Smaller maps will give you trader issues.  Larger maps are really unecessary, slow to make, slow to load, but you do you.
This can make finding the Trader intially more difficult, read the troubleshooting notes.
Disable both if using CompoPack! CompoPack does it's own thing for RWG, and other mods that effect RWG settings can mess it up.

"Syrinuv JetArmorMod" OP, enabled.
Adds a JetPack armor mod. You won't hover in mid-air, it's more like a super long jump.
You must remove the helmet flashlight, and  not hold a Izy gun.
Press the F key to super long jump forward.
Do not use from a roof top unless you like broken legs.  Or, max out Parkor, or take the Oh Shitz Drops candy first.
Tip : Holding shift while moving forward pressing F + SpaceBar gives you a great boost forward. 7 League Boots :)

"Syrinuv ShockArmorMod" OP, disabled.
A mod that can be installed on armor to shock enemy when they hit you.

"TiaoZao MiniMap" UI Suite Options, disabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. 
Choose one mimimap mod! 
This optional version displays the minimap in the mid-right of the screen.

"WMMChangeColorOfCoalOnMap"
Changes the color of Coal on the map screen from a black dot to a red dot making it easier to spot. Again WookieNookie doing the Lord's work.  

"My Time At Sandrock Food Pack" Decor, disabled.
Really nice food and oven pack.  

Mods Updated: 

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack04 GNS Armors"
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack05 TactiGirls"
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack02 VanillaRevamp"
"CATUI"
"Secret Base"
"Weather Returns"
"Zombie Fall Damage"
"Oakraven Chicken Coops"
"LittleRedSonja's Shopping Time" Added new optional Add-Ons to the main mod.
"EFTX Suite"
"Weather is Real"
"True Third Person"

Mod Status change:
"LittleRedSonja Plumbed In Water Solutions"
Currently other UI/HUD mods break the compatibility of this mod. Until I can figure out how to fix it, it is disabled by default. 
I will look into it as time permits.  

__________________________________________________________

2.1.1: 17:10 EST 15JUL2025

Major Revision Warning!
The Smorgasbord ModList has moved to Stable game version 2.1b7.
FULL STOP: Do not try to update your 2.0 game to 2.1! You will most likely need to start a new game!
If you ignore this advice and try to move your 2.0 game to a 2.1 game with this ModList, it will most likely destroy your game!
I tested this on two tester worlds I had in 2.0, and it broke both of my test saves.  
You could try making a backup, but here's your boy Fin telling you that it's probably a waste of time.
There's no reason to update the game/list if you are happy to continue in your current playthrough!
You are not missing out on any major uplifts, just wait to update the game/list until you start a new game!
YOU WERE WARNED!

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Armor Racks" Decor & Armor, enabled.
Adds an Armor Rack to display suits of armor.  This returned after it's update.  

"Gouki's Trader Smoothies" Biome Progression, enabled.
Adds Biome Smoothies to trader vending machine inventories.

"Plant on Dirt" OP, disabled.
You don't need a Farm Plot, now you can plant seeds on existing dirt, or create a dirt block (from clay).
Reminder, a dirt block is an earthen brown dirt looking block, not the normal grass block that yields clay when you dig it up. 
Nor is it sand. Dirt is uniquely it's own block in the game.  
OP, disabled by default.  

"Better Lighting" Graphics... enabled.  
This is one of two lighting options now available for the ModList. 
Choose this mod, or "World Lighting Tuned", but not both. 
Better Lighting adds a more natural Eye Light Adaption phase between sunny and shaded areas for more realistic lighting.
You can go to that NexusMods page and also download the ReShade manually and add it to your own game if you so choose.
I do not add/offer ReShades to this ModList.  Watch a YouTube video if you want to know how to use ReShade.
I find the World Lighting Tuned to be darker, and less realistic, but I like it's deeper darkness and color saturation levels.  
Lighting purists will prefer Better Lighting's more realistic shadows and eyesight light-level acclimation.  

"Drone Weapons" OP, enabled. 
Adds weapon mods available to the drone. 
You add the weapon mod to the drone itself within your backpack, deploy the drone in game, add the specific drone-weapon-mod ammo to it's drone inventory.
Then you can give the drone simple combat orders with the Tab key radial menu. 
Just set it to 'fire at will'.
I like it, but for late game when you don't care about stealth.

"Weather Returns"
Weather Returns seeks to bring back and expand upon the pre-2.0 temperature and weather system. Below are some of the key features of Weather Returns:
Body temperature makes a return
Wetness makes a return
Hypo- and Hyper-thermia resistance make a return on all armor sets
Insulated Liner and Cooling Mesh Return
New All Season Liner mod
New TPU Liner mod (waterproof)
New Insulated TPU Liner mod
New Cooling TPU Liner mod
Hot, Sweltering, Cold, and Freezing debuffs make a return
Hot now makes you thirsty, decreases stamina regen, and decreases weapon handling and reload speed
Sweltering does all that hot does, but worse. You will also occasionally become heat-stroked, and be stunned for a few seconds
Cold now makes you hungrier, decrease stamina regen, and slows down scavenging, crafting, lock picking, and reloading. Lockpicks will also break more often.
Freezing does all that cold does, but worse.
All weather debuffs will slowly make your character weaker, decreasing your max health the longer you stay outside of homeostasis. Get back to a comfortable temperature to regain your max health!
Get back your health faster by cooling down under some shade or in water, or by heating by a warm fire
Campfires and torches dry you off and warm you
Desperate for warmth? Set yourself on fire!
Various drinks now give you the "Cooled" buff, helping you stay cool for a period of time
Various drinks now give you the "Warmed" buff, helping you stay warm for a period of time
Coffee, Blackstrap, and Yucca Juice Smoothies get their temperature insulating properties back
Old Yucca Juice Smoothie bug fixed, now cools you down instead of heating you up
From Fin: I have tested this with the other Biome Progression mods enabled with this section.  If you see something concerning, please let me know.  

Mods Updated: 
"VoltraLux POI Pack"
"CAT UI"
"Custom FPV FOV"
"The Descent"

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.  
I have been able to continue my same playthrough, but YMMV.

Comments: 

This revision to the ModList is really just a few hot fixes.

The ModList is still on 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stable version.    

Mods Removed: 
All of the Requirement mods that were supporting the Closer Weapons Pack.  
That pack is gone, and the reqs were duplicated in EFTX.

Mods Added:
N/A

Mods Updated: 
"Modded CompoPack" Stallion fixed a RWG error when you combined the CompoPack with Descent. Zyncosa_Mine
"High Performance Running Shoe footwear mod" Fixed localization bug
"LittleRedSonja & Mumpfy's ArmorPack01 DangerGirls" Small fixes.
"Firefly Avatar for VRoid" The author improved her shadow.  You might have to reload her to fix it.  I noticed it's improved, but still a little blinky.  
"VRoid" Improved OmniShadows on Avatars. Also Updated to allow a page-through the radial menu for additional dances.  I added the Dance pack mod to the main folder so it's now in the game.

2.0.4: 17:10 EST 11JUL2025

Personal news: I am leaving a terrible job for greener pastures in my career.  
I'm sorry, I don't like to complain about personal stuff in public, but that place was killing me.  
So, I will have a shorter commute, and I might be able to work from home occasionally.  
I really hit it off with my new boss, so I have high hopes it will be a better work environment than the last position.

Fin's Shout-out thank yous:
1. ShadowWolf579 for finding and squashing a bug with Tool Time.  It was making players lose experience when mining.
He also found the Beefy Reload issue below.  
2. All of the new people trying Smorgasbord for the first time.  Welcome, and glad to have you with us.  
3. Everyone testing, and being patient with the bugs we keep unearthing.  I can't do it alone, so I appreciate all the help from everyone.  

Mods Removed: 
"Beefy Reload Speed".  It was causing a double-reload animation on Izy Vanilla Replacer guns.
"No Stamina Drain on Aiming Down Sight" Not compatible with modded guns, throwing an annoying Warning.
"Closer's Experimental Weapons Pack" Causing compatibility issues.
You can add it to your own game, it's stable, but I have to remove any mods with warnings that cause crafting issues.

Mods Added:

"Firefly" VRoid Avatar.  
I already added it to VRoid. 
She's cute, but the shadows aren't applied to her properly.  
I have already informed the author.  He got the shadows right on his AzureLane NewJersey girl.  

"QuickStack" Previously, it was throwing errors. It's working again.  Woot!  

"Increase Lootstage Cap"
Sets the LootCap to high in all biomes, so you don't need to leave the Forest Biome if you don't want to. 
Thanks Chessa!  

"Modded CompoPack Suite" Adds about 4,000 POIs.  
CompoPack POIs are much more challenging than vanilla!  You will die more often inside of them!
The CompoPack adds time to RWG and loading into the world.  
Additionally, a handful of the POIs are over 150x150 blocks in size, causing those few to render in poorly at times. 
The aesthetics are a mixed bag, please don't complain about it. This mod is a "historical preservation society" for every community made POI ever made. 
The POIs have been preserved as-is, from earlier Alphas.  Not everyone is a great artist, but we appreciate their contributions all the same.  
If you don't like their look or challenge, that's fine, but please don't complain about it.  Just play without these mods.
Please remember, a lot of love and hard work went into making and preserving these POIs.  

Mods Updated: 
"OCB mods" most of them were updated for v2.  
"CBP"
"Bdubs Vehicles"
"Voltralux POI Pack"
"Witos Camera"
"Natural Progression"
"Tool Time" The version did not change, we made an internal patch you are now receiving.
"Izy AIO v5" It didn't really change, just repackagaed the same upload because some users said they couldn't download/unzip it properly.  
"True Third Person"

2.0.3: 17:45 EST 08JUL2025

Comments: 

1. The ModList has been updated for 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stbale version.    

2. Adjusted VRoid to remove the excessive number of not fully functional Avatars.  
As Avatars are updated to 2.x, I will reintroduce them. 
This should bring the storage requirement down, and I apologize for not considering the size implication.
I added a section to the ReadMe about Vroid if you want more information.  

Mods Removed: 
1. All NPC mods.  
These might come back at some point in the future of the list, but I spent too much time testing to remove some bugs, and I can't find them all.
It's not the fault of the NPC-Core mod, it's just too many other mods on the list are throwing compatibility issue when I add in NPC-Core.
If I had to choose other mods I like to play with personally, over NPC-Core, I will always choose the other mods on the list.  
Something on my list was causing unkillable vultures to spawn inside of POIs with NPCCore enabled.  
If one of you folks with more time than I have want to try to track it down, by all means please share your results.  

2. All of the mods that have not been updated for 2.x.  
All of the major Mod Authors have made the biggy updates that were easy fixes for 2.0.
Anything else could take substantially longer.
Most of the mods that have not been updated are for sound.  
Those actually are easy fixes, just a directory fix, but that's on them to fix their mods.  
Give them time.

3. "Thor" It was throwing too many errors.  I just don't have the time for nuanced troubleshooting right now.  
This one has always been a bit tempermental on this list, it might not be coming back.

4.  "OCB No Sudden Exit"
I expect this one to return when OCB Maurice updates the mod for v2.  

Mods Added:
"Shared Reading"
"VRoid Dance Pack" 
"LittleRedSonja & Mumpfy's Armor Pack 5: TactiGirls"
"Pant's Lightsaber"

Mods Updated: 
"VRoid"
"Score"
"True Third Person View"

2.0.2: 19:00 EST 04JUL2025

Comments: 

1. Added VRoid Support.  It makes playing third person super fun.  
Currently only 3 of the default Avatars have full animation and hand placement support.  
We just need to wait on the mod authors to update their Avatars accordingly in time.  
And VRoid is not just for weebs, there's human looking characters too, not just cute anime girlies.  

2. Adjusted WalkerSim from Population Desnisty 300, down to 180.  Sorry, 300 was overkill.  
If you liked it that way, it's easy to adjust in the xml yourself.
I only learned I could proliferate xml/folder changes to players through Wabbajack today.  Neat!  

Mods Removed:

Mods Added:
"More Shots" I think he fixed and updated for 2.0.  Adds rifle and bow/crossbow mods.  I tested, seemed fine.  

"VRoid Mod" + all of the Avatars I baked in.

"True ThirdPerson - Early Access" 
How to Use:
Press F5 to toggle between first-person and third-person views.
While in third-person, click the middle mouse button to switch the camera between the right and left shoulder.

2.0.1: 19:30 EST 04JUL2025

MAJOR UPDATE!

Comments: 

1. The Smorgasbord ModList is now exclusively compatible with 7 Days to Die game version: 2.0b295 
This is a major revision to the list, you will need to RWG a new world and start a new game.

2. Smorgasbord is now compatible with 7DVR, BUT (big BUT) you must manually unzip the latest supported version of 7DVR files directly into your base-game files.  
Search the GitHub ReadMe here for 7DVR to read more details.  

4. With 2.0, I gutted a ton of mods that had mild to moderate compatibility issues.
I don't have the time I previously did to help users troubleshoot.  
Also, the list is becoming more popular, meaning there's more people seeking assistance.  
So I have even less time to help community members.  
I have to dummy-proof the list to cut down on time spent troubleshooting.  

Known Issues:
1. One benign Error with Izy's AIO "Akimbo" reference.  Will be patched next week or so. 
There are some minor issues with Izy AIO v5, but still playable.  
2. Several benign Warnings. None of these have caused problems.
3. Some foliage is flickering.  I haven't determined what that is.  
4. I forgot to disable OCB Parachute.  It pops open the console with a benign error.  You can disable as you choose.

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.  

Comments: 

Planning for 2.0.  Once it releases in experimental, I will be checking/fixing my own POI Pack first and foremost.  
Then checking my other mods still work in 2.0.
After that, I will be testing Smorgasbord with 2.x while it's in the experimental beta.  
As a reminder, I will not publish an update to Smorgasbord until game version 2.x goes STABLE!
I only support Stable releases because I have had it bite me in the past.  
I can keep you guys aware of the changes in my channel at Guppy's.
If it appears to be working in 2.x experimental, I'll let you know there.

"Cloud's Combine Toolbox" OP Optional, enabled.  
Adds a special Green Combining Toolbox that you place in your backpack, exit the backpack UI, then re-enter the backpack menu screen.
Example: You have two tier 1 wrenches, you combine into one tier 2 wrench.  
If you don't see the third box of the Combining Toolbox filling up with the higher tier item, it's because you need to level up your Salvage skill.
With points into the Salvage skill, you can combine two of the same item to make a higher tier new version.  Up to tier 5!
This works with vanilla items, Izy guns, and EFTX guns.

Comments: 

1. You will 100% need to start a new save with this update.  
This is because of the changes made to EFTX.
On a positive note: 
StallionsDen segmented the EFTX gun assets in a separate component mod... 
This file will not be updated very often allowing revisions to this ModList to take you less time to download going forward.  
This will save you from updating those 5GB every time you need to update Smorgasbord going forward.  

2. I did move a few mods around, and enabled a few others.  I also swapped to Vanilla only ammo by default for enabled, but you can swap as you like.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"TheMeanOnes Zombies Can't Dig" 
Optional Zombie Spawning & Behavior mod, enabled by default.  Zombies will not dig unless you manually configure a type to do so in the xml file.  
I don't personally like digging zombies, especially how it screws up their pathing... like digging at the rim of a hole above you instead of dropping down towards you.    

"Timely Drones" 
Optional OP Mod, More reasonable recipe to unlock the drone earlier making it actualy relevant in time for it to matter in your playthrough.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack03 Some Traders" 
Optional Armor/Decor mods, enabled.

1. LegionOfTheFallen for making a mod with Smorgasbord in mind.  It is sincerely appreciated.  
2. StallionsDen for patching/adding things to his mods because Smorgasbord Community Members asked for more stuff.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Better Biomes - PickUp Plants Add-On Patch" Optional Graphics (just to keep it next to BB).
I added this primarily for community member Cinnaspice, but I like it myself as well... 'need that Goldenrod for the MegaCrush recipe.
This is an add-on to Better Biomes + TechFreq's PickUpPlants. 
From the Mod Author:
The 'Issue', ﻿MPLogue's Better Biomes mod is great at adding a wide diversity of flora to the game. 
However, when using TechFreq's Pickup Plants mod, they look like a harvestable plant. 
You will see the prompt to 'Press E to Pickup' on all the new added flowers, but if you pick them up it doesn't harvest them and instead adds a decorative plant block in your inventory. 
This really confused users on my server as they didn't recognize which flowers provided crafting ingredients, and which provided decorative flowers. 
We ended up with people unintentionally spending time harvesting decorative flowers and a storage box full of them at the base.
The 'Solution', I couldn't figure out how to disable the prompt on these plants (someone let me know if you know how!!) but I did figure out how to at least make them behave like existing in-game flowers and grant crafting materials. 
So when you harvest any of the flowers added by Better Biomes, (either by pressing E or by chopping them down) you will be granted a Goldenrod and a Chrysanthemum ingredient. 
Perhaps not very balanced, but it solved my players' frustration, and finding flower ingredients was never very difficult to begin with.
Requirements (this patch is useless without them)
- Better Biomes
- Pickup Plants

"LOTF Better Bullet Range" Optional OP, enabled.  Vanilla and EFTX Guns have longer range.  Does not work for other modded weapons.  
I personally like this because I prefer shotguns having longer range.  
I understand TFP reduces range for game balance, but being someone who shoots shotguns irl, it drives me crazy that buckshot does zero damage after 11 blocks (11m, or 33ft) .
It's maximum effective range is much further!  The spread of each pellet in the buckshot is still concentrated enough to do devastating damage at 16 blocks (16m, or 48ft).
If TFP had a better system where buckshot did less damage as distance increased, that would be ideal, but for now, this mod is great.  

"LOTF No Vanilla Ammo" Optional OP, disabled.
Please engage your brain when enabling this mod.  
You use this mod as an add-on when playing with 'Z2 EFT Extraction EFT Only Ammo' and "ZEFT_Exraction_No_Vanilla_Guns', while disabling Izy's mods.  
This is a simple mod that removes vanilla ammo from lootable cantainers, trader inventory, and quest rewards.

"Z3 EFTX Core Standard Food" Optional OP, enabled.  Adds EFT Food and beverages with eating animations for those items (exclusively).
I was able to add this mod to my existing save without issues.  

Updated: 

"WalkerSim" This mod is getting so good, it should become vanilla!  The latest update makes is awesome!  You'll see!  I'm not going to spoil the surprises!  Hehehe  

"CP Modded Core" StallionsDen made adjustments to Vulture drops that Smorgasbord Community Member GreenTheGhost requested.  Thank you both!  

"CP Modded Compat Patch EFT IZYS" 

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade" I increased the fuse delay and damage.  I also made the tin cans able to be scrapped for metal.  

__________________________________________________________

1.49: 09:50 EST 09MAY2025

Comments: 

1. Another hotfix on EFTX.  We leapfrogged from 1.4.0.6 to 1.4.0.8  
Always make a backup prior to updating the list if you are trying to play in the same save.  
There is no guarantee it will work.  Which is why I always recommend to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new save.
Again, I was able to continue playing in the same save of Smorgasbord from ModList versions 1.47 through 1.49 without issues, but your mileage may vary.  

2. Do not run MS Teams and 7DtD simultaneously.  Teams is a resource hog and will cause in-game loading to slow, and stutters in UI-menu screens.  
I have had dozens of other applications running concurrently without issue.  But Teams doesn't play nice.
I learned this the hard way.  I was pulling my hair out for an hour trying to figure out which new mod was causing my FPS to tank.  
Not a mod, just Teams.  Thanks Microsoft.

Added:

"LittleRedSonja Fancy Zombie Variants" Zombie Spawning mod, enabled by default.  
Adds new reskins of vanilla zombies to give them more variety in clothing and coloration.  
I confirmed the reskinned vanilla zombies are still lootable with EFTX... pastel-suited businessman can still be looted.  

"No Texture Streaming" Optional Performance/Graphics mod, enabled by default.
For most users, it gives them a small performance boost making textures load faster.  
This mod disables Texture Streaming so the quality of textures is never reduced automatically. In theory, this can have a negative impact on performance but, in my experience, the difference is not noticeable at all.  
YMMV.  Hardware, Mods, Settings, and other running applications will effect if this mod will work for your setup. 
The game has a system called Texture Streaming that automatically lowers the quality of some textures based on heuristics to save system resources and improve performance, 
but Texture Streaming is not smart about it and makes many wrong calls, so you can easily end up walking around in a fully rendered world where only a few textures look very low quality (like the car in the image), and those really stand out. 
This is especially noticeable for players with mid or low-end PCs or with other mods that add new blocks with their own custom textures to the game, but even players with high-end PCs will sometimes notice these.

Hotfix for EFTX and a few other small mods.  
I was able to update EFTX from 1.4.0.5 to 1.4.0.6 and continue playing in the same save. 
I was able to go from Smorgasbord v1.47 to 1.48 in the same save.  
It's always recommended to start a new game when you update this list, but you could make a backup and try.  
It worked for me.

Once again, to StallionsDen for the improvement and quick fixes to EFTX.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap"
"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap - Visible Enemy Dots"
These are both UI Mods, they're optional, and disabled by default. 
This mod adds a Sci-Fi themed Minimap to the bottom right corner of the screen.  
One version shows enemy dots on the minimap, the other doesn't.
Animal mobs (both hostile and prey types) do not show up as dots on the minimap.
You can play with the minimap settings under the GEARS "Mods" section in the Game's Menu Options.
GEARS Mods > Quartz > Minimap tab.  
The minimap has an overlap with the Steel-UI 15-slot toolbelt.  
You can live with it, use a different UI, disable the 15-Slot toolbelt, or use the Immersive Toolbelt mod so it's less of an issue. 
I actually tried both the Zombie Hunter and Scifi UI mods, but neither worked.  So, all we get is this optional Scifi minimap for now.

Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack suite"
"Ammo Press Add-On Patch for EFT and Izy" Minor mispelling in xml, my bad.  
"Rodent Reducer" I added an additional remover xml file because they kept spawning in some calls.

You will need to start a new game with this update, because the EFT Extraction Pack (EFTX) received another major update.   
Some of the other mods might have received updates to their progression.xml file, so again, start a new save.
If you're not ready to start a new save, there's no pressure, just wait to update the ModList.

StallionsDen for the tremendous effort he pours into EFTX.  

Removed: 
"TechFreqsBackToMainMenuMod" The author informed me it had a significant error issue depending on how it was used.  Removing for now.  

Added:

"Rodent Reducer add-on patch for Urban Decay" Optional, under graphics-performance separator, just to keep it near Urban Decay.  This removes rat/bat spawns by entirely from global random spawning.  
"Crouching Doesnt Make The Screen Go Dark" Optional QoL, enabled by default.  It disables that vignette dark border at the edge of the screen when you crouch.   
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack02 VanillaReVamp" Decor/Armor.  
"(V1) Vehicle Mods Crafting Skill" Reading Vehicle Magazines unlocks vehicle-mods.  
"TheMeanOnes Interchangable Skies" Optional QoL.  I disabled "Galaxy..." and enabled this one to do the same thing.  Both are there, choose one.  
"TheMeanOnes Loot Indicators"
"LittleRedSonja Timber Inc Table Saw" Standard, enabled.  Adds a new Table Saw workstation where you can trade dukes for stacks of wood.  
"LittleRedSonja Normalized Craft Times" Optional QoL, disabled by default.  Balances crafting times... some are shorter, most are longer.
"LittleRedSonja Flying Fancy Magic Broom" Vehicle mod, enabled.  For those of you who want to fly around on a broom.  

"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time FULL version" Optional OP, disabled by default (because it's pretty OP).  
This mod adds a craftable "Online Shopping Terminal" that allows you to buy, 24/7, from a selection of rare, difficult to find or highly demanded items, such as solar cells, engines, learning elixirs, duct tape, candies and much much more.

"Additional Research - add-on patch" OP Optional, enabled. 
This is an add-on patch to the 'Research' mod. I made this to allow players to craft EFTX magazines from the Research Workstation.  
It also supports the Knife, Sledgehammer, and Tool Time Books. 


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack" (new abbreviation is EFTX, it's what all the cool-kids are calling it).
Learn-by-reading (LbR) System update: EFTX-Core-Standard
There are new EFTX magazine series.   
What this means for you as a player:
1. You will now rarely find EFTX guns, only after Game Stage 15, and you will only pull tier 1 quality EFTX-guns. 
The emphasis of this mod has moved to crafting to get superior versions.
2. You can find tier 1 EFTX guns in these loot containers: toilets, military trucks, police cars, and gun safes. 
3. You need to read between 10 and 25 (depending on the weapon) related magazines to unlock the ability to craft it. 
Then you need to continue reading more magazines for additional crafting tier levels.
4. Vanilla Cop, Soldier, Mutants, and Nurse zombie corpses are now lootable. 
This will likely be your best source of EFTX magazines. 
They also have a small chance of dropping tier 1 EFTX guns. 
I cannot stress this enough: Looting Vanilla Cop, Soldier, and Mutant corpses is priority #1!!!
5. Ammo Piles are another great place to find EFTX Skill Magazines.  
6. I strongly encourage you to play at 100% Loot Abundance with EFTX going forward to give yourself the best odds to pull those new EFTX skill magazines.  
Please keep an open mind to the recent changes made to this mod, a lot of hard work went into this update.
Some people might not like all of the changes, but this was done to lengthen your playthrough and make it feel like you earned it when you get a higher tier EFT gun. 
Finding tier 6 doom-cannons on day 1 was broken, way too OP.
StallionsDen is open to constructive criticism, but please don't whinge!   
If you have any constructive criticism, please share it on the Nexus comments forum, or over at the #eft-only-guns channel at Guppy's Discord Server. 
For Smorgasbord, I disabled the 'zombies despawn in 6 seconds' mod.  It's still there, but since most players will be playing with EFTX, I wanted to make sure they had adequate time to loot those specified zombies. 
Knowing my player base fairly well, I made the "Additional Research" mod, as an option in Smorgasbord to help you get your preferred gun a little bit faster.

"Research" I changed the variant from Hardcore to Default to support users playing with EFTX.  Makes it slightly cheaper/faster.

Comments: 

Regarding mods from Non-NexusMods offsite locations; I will use offsite mods if they link to GitHub/GitLab locations.  
I am not going to use mods that go to ModDB/G-Drives because they force users to download and install the mods manually.  

A. Izy's Vanilla Replacer.  Izy added a few small fixes.

B. Removed the Western NPC mod for two reasons.  
It was throwing errors and it required users to manually manipulate it for installation from ModDB.
I have alerted the Mod Author, so it might be updated and return at some point in the future.  

C. EFT Extraction Pack was fixed.  
The Learn-by-Doing (LBD) system was removed.  
I have now set the Extraction suite back to enabled in MO2 by default.

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Kajdaniec for helping me test the download process for the new offsite mods.  
StallionsDen for working so hard on the EFT Extraction Pack revision.  

Removed: 
"Western Entity Pack for NPC-Core"

Added:

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade" Optional QoL mod.  
This mod does two things: 
1. Adds an empty tin can to the players inventory after consuming a canned food item. 
2. Adds a recipe that allows players to create small improvised (ghetto-rigged) Tin Can Grenades.
Throw it immediately or it will blow up in your hand.  

"Guppy's Motorized Shopping Cart" From LittleRedSonja, we ressurected a fun vehicle Guppy made years ago. 

"Better Pipe Guns" Optional OP Mod.  Increases the damage of the Pipe Rifle and Pipe Shotgun slightly, just to make them less useless.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy's DangerGirl ArmorPack01" Adds some new armor for the ladies.  

"IncreasedStackSize" mods of various sizes.  

"Thor Thunderstorm Mod" Optional, Graphic/Environmental.  
This is set to disabled by default, it can be resource intensive on some systems, but the latest update is working fine for me.

"Games Settings Extender" Optional QoL.  Do not go too far in either extreme for some of the game options or you could have upredictable results. 

"ChainMining" Optional OP Mod.  This is the VeinMining mod from Minecraft.  
If you mine one ore type with a mining tool, you will mine all of the conncted ore of the same type.

"QuickStop" Optional OP Mod.  Aim improves when you come to a full stop like in other FPS games.  

Updated: 

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"Oakraven's Balloons"
"TMO Trader Never Closes"
"WalkerSim"

Warning: Do not update this ModList until you are ready to start a new game!
This is a major ModList update!  
This update will very likely break your existing save.  
You've been warned!

Comments: 

1. This is the NPC Update many of you have been asking for.  
It was a farily large undertaking adding this stuff to the list and testing as much as I reasonably could (as one man with limited time).
I have noticed the Gears setting button is not in the Settings options currently, not sure if it's from the NPC Core addition, or another mod causing it to not show up... 
Gears is still applying but the button is not displaying... if anyone could help me figure this out, I'd appreciate it.  

2. EFT Extraction Pack received a major update.  
I have said it before, but have to say it again for new people: EFT Extraction Pack follows behind the EFT Overhaul modpack.  
This past week the EFT Overhaul modpack radically changed progression.  
They now use a Learn-By-Doing (LBD) System.  The EFT Overhaul did this for balance. Extraction Pack copied this to be inline with their changes.
What this means for users: 
A. You will miss something like 50% of your shots, even at point blank "impossible to miss" range until you level up.
B. Extremely sluggish aiming animation until you level up.
StallionsDen is planning an alternative, to offer a separate option that doesn't use the EFT Overhaul's Learn-By-Doing system.  
Please be patient, it wil take him some time to create a deviation.
Until that option becomes available, I am setting the EFT Extraction Suite mods to disabled on this ModList for the time being.  
They're there if you want to use them, but I know the majority of my player base will have mixed reactions to the current system.
If you don't like the change, keep it disabled for now, and just use Izy's for now...

3. For the first time, I have added Non-NexusMods "offsite" mods to the list.  
They should all still be one-click.  I purposefully avoided any mods that required users to manually manipulate.  
My secondary computer is on the fritz, so I cannot currently test the download process from the user perspective.  
You guys are my guinea pigs, if something didn't download right, please let me know.  
Fingers crossed, I set everything up correctly, and it should all work out alright... should, should. :)

Notice:
1. I start a new job next week so will not have as much time to devote to modding/troubleshooting.  Expect slower response times going forward.   
2. Izy is working on his AIO v5.0 update, hopefully releasing in a few weeks.   

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Grey.  He is working on providing the community with directions for converting this list to Linux Nobara.

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

NPC Separator and all mods therein.
You might notice a few missing NPC mods you see on other listings.  This is because the links were dead, or required manual manipulation, and I won't add those.
There are a few more NPC mods I tried, but were throwing errors so just skipped those for now.  I'll check them again in future updates.
I disabled all NPC mods by default, because they really do change the game drastically.  
Being shot at constantly, or seeing random giant spiders, or dinosaurs rubs some people the wrong way.
If you use NPC Mods, go into the in-game NPC Settings, and hit the checkbox to mute NPC Follower footstep sound effects... they'll drive you crazy if you don't.

"Guppy's Zombies": Zombie Spawning, Optional mod, adds zombie variety.
"KHZmusik Zombies": Zombie Spawning, Optional mod, adds zombie variety.

"WalkerSim" Zombie Spawning, Optional mod.  This replaces the normal Wandering Horde mechanic.  
I set this mod to enabled.  I'd like to hear some feedback from you folks on how you feel about it.
Zombies will be present as soon as you spawn in to a new world.  
This mod changes random global zombie spawning, so it is more uniquely organic.
This mod is set to default settings, but you can manually play with settings... see NexusMods page for details.  
The WalkerSim mod replaces wandering hordes which are spawned at random with a more complex simulation taking advantage of the entire map. 
The simulation will spawn the zombies when a player gets close and if the player is too far it will put them back into the simulation.  
This mod makes the "Wandering Horde Lootbags" and "Beefy Hordes" mods irrelevant.
Zombies will start spawning as soon as you enter the world.  
You will see daylight ferals in the forest biome on day one.  
I like this mod and think you should give it a fair try before disabling it.  

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer": OP mods, Optional.  Izy added an Optional mod called the Vanilla Replacer.  
This add-on mod replaces vanilla gun models, their animations, and sounds with new versions by Izayo. 
It also adds a kick-attack. Press the flashlight key to use. 
By default this is the F-key on a keyboard, or the D-pad Up button on an Xbox gamepad.  
The kick-function will only work on the vanilla-replaced guns.  Not Izy's other guns, nor EFT, etc.  

Updated: 

"LittleRedSonja Fancy Decor"
"Efficient Base Repair"
"EFT Extraction Pack" suite.
"Izy AIO Weapons Pack"

Comments: 
Users had a problem with Flogi's Perks Mod.  
It was updated so this revision of the Smorgasbord Modlist to 1.44 is mostly as a hotfix to that issue.  
While I was at it, I updated a few others... 

Notice:
EFT Extraction Pack and Izy are both planning an update in the near future, so the next update to Smorgasbord could be in the next few days. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
EyeOfWolf for reporting the issue with Flogi's Perk Mod.

Removed: 

Two of the OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn patches (because they were consolidated under one new file).  

Added:

"RWG POI Blocker" 
Optional POI mod, set to Disabled by default in MO2.  
Manual modification is required!  
Prevents user specified vanilla POIs from appearing on maps created by the vanilla RWG.  
By default it is set to block a few strip club POIs from spawning, but can easily be customized with your own list of POIs.  
Some users might want to use this mod to blacklist POIs like modded traders.

"(V1)-OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn"
Optional OP Mod... this was a consolodation of two other mods into one file.  

Updated: 

"Flogi's Perk Mod"
"Flogi's Quest Mod"
"World Tower"
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling"

1.43: 17:15 EST 11APR2025

Comments: 
The Smorgasbord ModList v1.43 is now compatible with 7DtD game version 1.4b8.
The new 1.4b8 stable version mostly fixed bugs, and did not add/subtract any features.
I did see some minor UI errors, 
but they didn't pop-open the console mid-game and I didn't see any game-breaking errors.  
I tested it for a few hours and didn't notice any other major problems.  
It's impossible for my testing to be exhaustive, so if you notice any new unreported issues,
please let me know so I can fix things.  

On a personal note: I will be starting a new job in two weeks, and will have less time support this modding.  
I will still be updating it, but my update frequency and responsiveness to troubleshoot will be slower.

Yes, we are still on STABLE version 1.3b9.  We will not move to 1.4b8 until it becomes stable and is tested.

1.39: 00:20 EST 30MAR2025

Comments: 

You can call this the Perks, Sounds, and Cars update.  

1. I added a new separator in MO2 for Optional OP Perks.  Either use "Legend Perks" or "Flogi's Perk..." NOT BOTH!!!  "Natural Progression" can be used with either.

2. Added an Optional Sound Mods separator. 

3. I also added a new Cars separator.  The people asked for more cool cars, so more cars it is.  
The new Luxury cars are set to default Metallic color.  
If you don't like that color, you can manually reinstall those individual mods on your own MO2 yourself.  
Only choose one color or the mod won't work!!!

4. I added a section to the ReadMe about using Lossless Scaling to improve 7DtD performance.  
It allows me to run Ultra on this ModList with smoother graphics, and less stutters.  
It's a bit of a process to set up, but worth it if you want to get the most out of your game.  
It's very Hardware specific.  Kajdaniec and I have different profiles, I posted both.  


As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to people who comment, troubleshoot, and provide feedback.
This week's shout-outs: 
Kajdaniec for being our "unnofficial" tester!  We did a lot of LS testing this week with great results!
Cinnaspice for finding an issue with Plant Collection Challenges.  It's been reported to the Mod Author, still a WiP.  
NobodyNobody666 for the Flogi's Perk suggestion.
CarnaeAssada for helping us identify a Mod Compatibility issue with Solar Powered.  
LittleRedSonja for assisting in chasing down the Solar Powered issue.  


Removed: 

"Solar Powered"  It's redundant with Oakraven's mods, and was causing a compatibility issue with FHD.  

Added:

"Robotic Drone Headlamp Soft White" Standard Mod.  Changes Drone light mod from blue to white.

"PGz Boosted Big Cities" POI/RWG mod. Increases city sizes and allows them to spawn in all biomes.  This is redundant if you play with the CompoPack.  

"(V1) Quests Per Tier - 20" For people who want to slow down their game!
Instead of 10 quests per quest tier level, this mod makes you complete 20 quests slowing down your progression to keep the game going longer.  

"Flogi's Perk Mod" Optional OP, 
"Flogi's Perk Mod XP HUD" Optional OP, 

"Fancy Home Decor - Add-On patch" Optional Decor Add-On patch to Fancy Home Decor.  
Now the lights don't need power, and you don't need to read the Wiring 101 magazines to unlock it.  
Allows you to loot some decor blocks and resuse them from POIs.  
If you turn these mods off mid-save, it can cause errors.

"St. Mary's Hospital" Epic POI mod.  

Sound mods and Vehicles stuff, see the new separators, too many mods to list, I'm tired of typing.


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack"
"ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns"
"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" tweaks to existing POIs.  
"Vault Pack for Descent"
"Danzo All Text With Shadow"
"Despawn Zombies Mod Optimize Zombie Despawning"

Comments: 
Updates to the ModList are usually dependant on other mods with their own dependencies getting updated.  
When the main EFT Overhaul ModPack updated last week, StallionsDen needed time to update and test the EFT Extraction Pack.
Then every day over the last week, there were like a dozen new updates of mods on the list.
Then I needed a chance to update and test Smorgasbord with all of the new updates, so that is why this update took a little longer.
I was also holding out for a new update to Izy, but that might take a bit longer...

Big thanks to Kajdaniec for creating, testing, and proving this list can work on a Dedicated Server.  
See the ReadMe on the GitHub page for reference.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Network Timeout Extension" Framework mod.  
Assists in multiplayer and Dedicated Server connection issues.  

"Galaxy Far Far Away" Optional QoL mod.  
It adds an interesting nightscape that randomly changes every night.  You can manually set one you prefer in the files.  

"(V1) Firefighter Driving Skill" Optional OP mod: 
Increases the benefit of reading The Fireman's Almanac Vol 7 : Emergency Driving.

"WMM AirDrops Spawn Zeds" Standard Mod. Spawns zombies when you go to collect the air drops.  

"WMM Loot Respawn Tweak" Standard Mod.  
Small modlet that shows what day and time a container will respawn.  
I don't think this is working with this list, still testing functionality.  

"WMM Trader Quest Map" Standard Mod. 
When you first talk to the trader about jobs, it will pop-open a map screen on the left allowing you to choose from every job available in your vicinity.
Just reengage the Trader about jobs to reopen this map screen.  Yes, I am aware of a bit of UI-screen overlap, but it works and isn't a major problem.  

"Custom FPV FOV" You can change these settings in GEARS from within the game.  

"GEARS Settings Saver" Saves GEARS settings between new worlds/games.    

"Add-on to Black Wolf's Better Loot Spawns for EFT-Extraction and Izy guns" Optional OP mod

Updated: 

"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS"
"RWG Mixer for Smorgasbord"

Comments: 
Be mindful of the two new Environmental mods as they are Resource Intensive and could drag your performance down.  

New Separator:"Zombie Spawning Options"
After feedback from users and my own testing, I think Beefy Hordes by GR is adding in more zombies to the regular world zombies spawning.
Some players were saying it was making the game a bit too hard.  

Removed: 
"Must Load Last..." Separator.  I repurposed it, the original was unecessary, and confused users.  

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.

"Better Biomes"
"Urban Decay"
These two are Environmental mods that add a ton of new decor to the game to make the world feel more organic.  
They're excellent, but are Resource Intensive!  
Do not use on older/weaker computers.  Even on a powerful PC, you might need to lower your settings. 

"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"SG Militia" POI.
"Dwarven Citadel" POI.
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
"MPLogue's Prefabs"

1.35: 12:30 EST 01MAR2025

Comments: 
Added a new Separator for Quests, since they have some extra comments for how they function... mostly as Mod Compatibility warnings.  

Removed: 
"MoreQuests" When combined with various other quests mods, it could sometimes cause compatibility issues.  
Replaced with a few other mods to achieve the same effect without the issues.    

Added:
"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable"
"Traders Have More Quests"
"Reset Trader's Quests"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's controls improvements for helicopters and planes": 
EXPERIMENTAL: I'm not entirely sure this mod is working, could users please let me know on Discord/GitHub? 
Installing this mod was problematic, because of how the folders were subdivided. 
I think I got it to take, but I want users to confirm this installation worked for them.

"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" switched over to one by LittleRedSonja, because it can do modded workstations.  

Added:
"Grab your stuff" Pick up crates, workstations, and special modded workstations like Oakraven's stuff.
Once again, LittleRedSonja was kind enough to extend the compatibility of her mod to support our Smorgasbord.
Please Endorse her mods and let her know you appreciate her work!

Comments: 

1. Added an optional sleeping system mod: "7 Days of Insomnia". If you don't want to play with it, that's fine, again, it's optional!   

2. Shuffled some mods around on the list to better categorize them.  

3. Using "TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" mod, it doesn't currently work on the modded-oakraven workstations, only vanilla workstations.  
I might make a patch add-on for this...

4. Because we are the primary guinea pigs for the EFT Extraction Pack, if you notice a balance issue, please let me or StallionsDen know.
Example: We might pull the surgical kit in a future update... it doesn't function like it does in the EFT Overhaul, is worth too much money, and is too common to find.  

Removed: 
"More Shots" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  
"Falcons Bike changes" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  Sad to see this one go, but not worth the knots it tied everything up in.  
"Sleep Unitl Dawn", replaced by Insomnia.
"Jakmeister999's REASONABLE Large Stacks (V1.0)" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"REASONABLE Large Stacks for IZY AIO" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"

"RuntimeOCD" to help troubleshoot errors.  Please keep this one if you send me logs to troubleshoot for you!    
"7 Days of Insomnia" Sleep system.
"Dewtas Car Respawner"
"Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"Craftable Helmet Attribute Mods"
"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests" Minor mod compatibility note: This does not work with the "MoreQuests" mod.  
You cannot do these jobs until you have returned others to the traders... limited simultaneous jobs.

"The Descent" fixed the EFT lighting bug, and other lighting issues.
"Mega Pack I" for The Descent.  
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling".

Comments: 
Shucks howdy this is the biggest update I have ever done.

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatibility.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
So I also made a patch for Oakraven's Ammo Press to support Izy and the "EFT Extraction Pack".

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, cause errors, or unnecessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, no errors, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod, but from the playtesting I have done so far, it works just fine.
This Mod is Experimental!  
The Descent adds time to RWG and loading into the world.
Currently Descent has some lighting issues that will be resolved in the next update, within a week or so.  
Known issue: If you play with both the Descent and the EFT Extraction Pack, you cannot run or jump while a player light-source is on.  
I reported the bug to the author, he will patch it in a week or so.  

4. UI Options: Some players absolutely hate the CAT UI.  So, I gave them more options.  
They can now choose from four optional UI Suites: CAT UI, Steel UI, AGF HUD UI, or disable them all for the vanilla UI.

Removed: 
"Reclaim Storage Crates", replaced with a better version.

Disabled: 
"Little Buddy" currently bugged, 'worked with LRS to give the author the fix.  Keeping in the list until the author updates their mod.

1.20 17:45 EST 11JAN2025

Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.

1.13: 21:00 EST 01JAN2025

It was accidentally withheld from the WJ "ignore disabled" list.

Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.

Fixed MO2 download issue, updated FNS POI Packs.  

1.9: 03:00 EST 31DEC2024

1.3: 20:00 EST 21DEC2024
Removed: KHV1's 12 Slot Crafting Queue because it caused an unsightly UI overlap. 
Swapped: EpicSpire's 66-Slot Backpack for CAT UI's native 91-Slot Backpack for a better overall UI cohesiveness.
