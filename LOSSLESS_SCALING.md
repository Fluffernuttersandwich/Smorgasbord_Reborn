# 🚀 Lossless Scaling with Smörgåsbord

Lossless Scaling (LS) is a **paid Steam application** that can provide:
- Frame Generation
- Reduced stutter
- Smoother gameplay on high-refresh monitors

This is **optional** and **hardware-dependent**.  
If you are comfortable with tweaking performance tools, LS can help.  
If not — skip it. Smörgåsbord works without it.

## Who Should Consider Using LS

You should consider LS if:

1. You have a **120Hz+ monitor** (higher is better)
2. You are okay playing games **windowed**
3. You can follow setup instructions carefully
4. You understand this game is **CPU-bottlenecked**

RTX GPUs benefit more, but RTX is **not required**.

## Critical Settings (Do Not Skip)

### In 7 Days to Die
- **Disable VSync**

If you do not disable VSync in-game, the game will enter slow-motion.

### You MAY keep VSync enabled in:
- Monitor
- NVIDIA Control Panel
- Lossless Scaling application

## General LS Configuration Guidelines

- LS works best with a **stable base framerate**
- Lock FPS using RTSS if possible
- Frame Generation performs best when input FPS is stable

This game is not well optimized — LS helps smooth *frame pacing*, not raw FPS miracles.

## Important Notes

- LS is **system-specific**
- Your mileage may vary
- LS is not officially supported by The Fun Pimps
- This is a community optimization tool

If LS causes instability:
- Disable it
- Return to vanilla graphics settings

Smörgåsbord does not require LS to function correctly.
